               <h6 class="question">Question 1</h6>
               Renu purchases two bags of fertiliser of weights 75 kg and 69 kg. Find the maximum value of weight which
               can measure the weight of the fertiliser exact number of times.

               <h6 class="answer">Answer 1</h6>

               Weight of two bags of fertiliser = 75 kg and 69 kg<br>

               For maximum weight <br> HCF of 75 and 69<br>

               Factor of 75 = 3 × 5 × 5<br>

               Factor of 69 = 3 × 23<br>

               HCF = 3<br>

               3 kg of weight can measure the weight of the fertiliser exact number of times.<br><br>

               <h6 class="question">Question2</h6>
               Three boys step off together from the same spot. Their steps measure 63 cm, 70 cm and 77 cm respectively.
               What is the minimum distance each should cover so that all can cover the distance in complete steps?

               <h6 class="answer">Answer 2</h6>
               For minimum distance we need to find out LCM of 63cm,70cm and 77cm<br>
               First steps measure = 63 cm<br>

               Second steps measure = 70 cm<br>

               Third steps measure = 77 cm<br>


               LCM (70 , 77) = 2 × 3 × 3 × 5 × 7 × 11 = 6930<br>

               So, the minimum distance is 6930cm<br><br>

               <h6 class="question">Question 3</h6>
               The length, breadth and height of a room are 825 cm, 675 cm and 450 cm respectively. Find the longest
               tape which can measure the three dimensions of the room exactly.

               <h6 class="answer">Answer 3</h6>

               Length of a room = 825 cm<br>

               Breadth of a room = 675 cm<br>

               Height of a room = 450 cm<br>

               Factor of 825 = 3 × 5 × 5 × 11<br>

               Factor of 675 = 3 × 3 × 3 × 5 × 5<br>

               Factor of 450 = 2 × 3 × 3 × 5 × 5<br>

               HCF = 3 × 5 × 5 = 75 cm<br>

               Hence longest tape is 75 cm.<br><br>

               <h6 class="question">Question 4</h6>
               Determine the smallest 3-digit number which is exactly divisible by 6, 8 and 12.<br>

               <h6 class="answer">Answer 4</h6>


               NCERT Solutions for Class 6 Maths Chapter 3 Exercise 3.7 - 7

               LCM = 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 = 24<br>

               the smallest 3-digit 100<br>

               24 × 4 = 96 and 24 × 5 = 120<br>
               So, 120 is the smallest 3-digit number which is exactly divisible by 6, 8 and 12<br>

               <h6 class="question">Question 5</h6>
               Determine the greatest 3-digit number exactly divisible by 8, 10 and 12.

               <h6 class="answer">Answer 5</h6>

               LCM of 8, 10 and 12


               LCM (8,10,12)= 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 5 = 120<br>

               the greatest 3-digit multiple of 999<br>

               999= 120 × 8 + 39<br>
               So the number is 999-39=960<br>
               So, 960 is the greatest 3-digit number divisible by 8, 10 and 12<br><br>

               <h6 class="question">Question 6</h6> The traffic lights at three different road crossings change after
               every 48 seconds, 72 seconds and 108 seconds, respectively. If they change simultaneously at 7 a.m., at
               what time will they change simultaneously again?

               <h6 class="answer">Answer 6</h6>

               LCM of 48, 72, 108 <br>


               LCM(48,72,108) = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 3 = 432<br>

               Here lights will change together after every 432 seconds <br>

               The lights will change at 7 minutes 12 seconds.<br>

               <h6 class="question">Question 7</h6> Three tankers contain 403 litres, 434 litres and 465 litres of
               diesel, respectively. Find the maximum capacity of a container that can measure the diesel of the three
               containers exact number of times.

               <h6 class="answer">Answer 7</h6>

               HCF of 403, 434, 465<br>

               Factor of 403 = 13 × 31<br>

               Factor of 434 = 2 × 7 × 31<br>

               Factor of 465 = 3 × 5 × 31<br>

               HCF = 31<br>

               Hence, a container of 31 litres are require to measure the quantity<br><br>

               <h6 class="question">Question 8</h6>
               Find the least number which when divided by 6, 15 and 18 leave remainder 5 in each case.

               <h6 class="answer">Answer 8</h6>

               LCM of 6, 15, 18<br>


               LCM(6,15,18) = 2 × 3 × 3 × 5 = 90<br>

               Required number = 90 + 5<br>


               So 95 is the required number.<br>



               <h6 class="question">Question 9</h6> Find the smallest 4-digit number which is divisible by 18, 24 and
               32.

               <h6 class="answer">Answer 9</h6>

               LCM of 18, 24, 32<br>

               LCM(18, 24, 32) = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 = 288<br>

               The smallest 4-digit number is 1000<br>
               On dividing 1000 by 288<br>
               1000=288 × 3+ 136<br>
               The require number is 1000 + (288 -136)= 1152

               <h6 class="answer">Answer 10</h6>

               (a) LCM of 9, 4<br>


               LCM(9,4) = 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 = 36<br>

               (b) LCM of 12, 5<br>

               LCM(12,5) = 2 × 2 × 3 × 5 = 60<br>

               (c) LCM of 6, 5<br>


               LCM (6,5)= 2 × 3 × 5 = 30<br>

               (d) LCM of 15, 4<br>

               LCM(15,4) = 2 × 2 × 3 × 5 = 60<br>

               Yes in each case the LCM of given numbers is the product of these numbers.<br>



               <h6 class="question">Question 11</h6> Find the LCM of the following numbers in which one number is the

               (b) 6, 18<br>

               LCM(6,18) = 2 × 3 × 3 = 18<br>

               (c) 12, 48<br>

               LCM(12,48) = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 = 48<br>

               (d) 9, 45<br>
               LCM(9,45) = 3 × 3 × 5 = 45<br>
