      <h6 class="question">Question 1</h6>

      Find the HCF of the following numbers :<br>
      (a) 18, 48 (b) 30, 42
      (c) 18, 60(d) 27, 63
      (e) 36, 84(f) 34, 102(g) 70, 105, 175
      (h) 91, 112, 49<br>
      (i) 18, 54, 81
      (j) 12, 45, 75
      <h6 class="answer">Answer 1</h6>


      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-6">

          <p>
            (a) 8,48<br>

            Factor of 18 = 2 x 3 x 3<br>
            Factor of 48 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 3<br>
            Required HCF = 2 x 3 = 6<br>



            (b) 30, 42<br>
            factor of 30 = 2 x 3 x 5<br>
            Factor of 42 = 2 x 3 x 7<br>
            Required HCF = 2 x 3 = 6<br>

            (c) 18,60<br>
            Factor of 18 = 2 x 3 x 3<br>
            Factor of 60 = 2 x 2 x 3 x 5<br>
            Required HCF =2x 3 =6<br>



            (d) 27,63<br>
            Factors of 27 = 1 x 3 x 3 x 3.<br>
            Factors of 63 =1 x 3 x 3 x 7.<br>
            Highest of these common factors is 3 x 3<br>.
            H.C.F. of 27 , 63 is 9.

            (e) 36,84<br>
            36 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 3<br>
            84 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 7<br>
            Required HCF = 2 × 2 × 3 = 12<br>
            f) 34,102 <br>
            34 = 2 × 17<br>

            102 = 2 × 3 × 17<br>

            Required HCF = 2 × 17 = 34<br>

            So,the HCF of 34, 102 is 34

        <div class="col-lg-6">

          <p>



            (g) 70,105,175<br>
            Factors of 70 = 2 × 5 × 7<br>

            Factors of 105 = 3 × 5 × 7<br>

            Factors of 175 = 5 × 5 × 7<br>

            Required HCF = 5 × 7 = 35<br>

            So,the HCF of 70, 105 and 175 is 35

            (h) 91,112,49<br>
            Factors of 91 = 7 × 13<br>

            Factors of 112 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 7<br>

            Factors of 49 = 7 × 7<br>

            Required HCF = 7<br>
            So,the HCF of 91, 112 and 49 is 7<br>

            (i) 18,54,81<br>
            Factors of 18 = 2 × 3 × 3<br>

            Factors of 54 = 2 × 3 × 3 × 3<br>

            Factors of 81 = 3 × 3 × 3 × 3<<br>

              Required HCF = 3 × 3 = 9<br>

              Therefore the HCF of 18, 54 and 81 is 9<br>
              (j) 12, 45, 75<br>
              Factors of 12 = 2 × 2 × 3<br>

              Factors of 45 = 3 × 3 × 5<br>

              Factors of 75 = 3 × 5 × 5<br>

              Required HCF = 3<br>

              So the HCF of 12, 45 and 75 is 3<br>

      <h6 class="question">Question 2</h6>
      What is the H.C.F. of two consecutive :<br>
      (a) numbers?<br>
      (b) even numbers?<br>
      (c) odd numbers?<br>
      <h6 class="answer">Answer 2</h6>
      (a) The H.C.F. of two consecutive numbers is 1.<br>
      Ex: The HCF of 11 and 12 is 1<br>
      (b) The H.C.F. of two consecutive even numbers is 2.<br>
      Ex The HCF of 6 and 8 is 2<br>
      (c) The H.C.F. of two consecutive odd numbers is 1.<br>
      ExThe HCF of 7 and 9 is 1<br> <br>
      <h6 class="question">Question 3</h6>
      H. C.F. of co-prime numbers 4 and 15 was found as follows factorization: 4 = 2 × 2 and 15 = 3 × 5 since there is
      no common prime factor, so H.C.F. of 4 and 15 is 0. Is the answer correct? If not, what is the correct H.C.F?
      <h6 class="answer">Answer 4</h6>
      No, the answer is not correct. The correct answer is 1 :
      H.C.F. of 4 and 15 is 1.<br><br>
