               <h6 class="question">Question 3</h6>
               Can you think of creating a shape that would give a circular shadow if held in one way and a rectangular
               shadow if held in another way?

               <h6 class="answer">Answer 3</h6>

               Yes,

               <img class="mode" width="500" src="/Pathanto/image/shadow.png"><br>
               A cylinder gives circular shape when showed the bottom side and rectangle when showed
               horizontally.<br><br>

               <h6 class="question">Question 4</h6>
               In a completely dark room, if you hold up a mirror in front of you, will you see a reflection of yourself
               in the mirror?

               <h6 class="answer">Answer 4</h6>
               No in a dark room we will not be able to see our reflection in the mirror . Image is formed by a mirror
               due to the reflection of light from any object. We can only see in the presence of light<br><br>
