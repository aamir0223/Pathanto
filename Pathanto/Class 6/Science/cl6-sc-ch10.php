      1 metre, 1 centimetre, 1 kilometre, 1 millimetre.
      <h6 class="answer">Answer 4</h6>

      (b)
      we know <br>
      one cm = 10mm<br>
      65 x 100 x 10 mm = 1650 mm.<br><br>

        <span class="symbol">/</span>
        <span class="bottom">1000</span>

      </div>
      =3.25km<br>
      The distance between Radha’s home and her school is 3.250km<br><br>


      <h6 class="question">Question 7</h6>
      While measuring the length of a knitting needle, the reading of the scale at one end is 3.0 cm and at the other
      end is 33.1 cm. What is the length of the needle?
      <h6 class="answer">Answer 7</h6>
      Length of the needle = 33.1 cm – 3.0 cm = 30.1 cm.<br><br>

      <h6 class="question">Question 8</h6>
      Write the similarities and differences between the motion of a bicycle and a ceiling fan that has been switched
      on.
      <h6 class="answer">Answer 8</h6>
      (i) Similarity: Both the wheel of a bicycle and a ceiling fan exhibit motion on a fixed axis ansd show circular
      motion.<br>
      (ii) Difference: As Bicycle show both circular and leaner motion so bicycle executes rectilinear motion but fan
      does not show such motion.<br><br>

      <h6 class="question">Question 9</h6>
      Why could you not use an elastic measuring tape to measure distance? What would be some of the problems you would
      meet in telling someone about a distance you measured with an elastic tape?
      <h6 class="answer">Answer 9</h6>
      An elastic tape can be stretched. It can not be used to measure distances because the tape length can change when
      it is stretched. So we need to tell how much taps has been stretched which is difficult. Consequently, the
      measured length would not be correct<br><br>




      <h6 class="question">Question 10</h6>
      Give two examples of periodic motion.
      <h6 class="answer">Answer 10</h6>
      (i) rocking chair<br>
      ii)Rotation of earth.<br>
      (iii)a vibrating tuning fork.<br>
