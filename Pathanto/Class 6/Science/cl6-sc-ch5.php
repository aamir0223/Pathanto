      <h5 class="sc-exercise"> Exercise Question</h5>

      <h6 class="question">Question 1:</h6>
      Why do we need to separate different components of a mixture? Give two examples.

      <h6 class="answer">Answer 1</h6>

      When two or more substances are mixed together they form a mixture. Among different components of mixture there
      are many substances which are harmful or not useful for us. To remove these harmful we need to separate them. For
      example:<br>
      (a) Tea leaves are separated from the liquid with a strainer while preparing tea.<br>
      (b)Evaporation removes a liquid from a solution to leave a solid material.<br>
      (c)Filtration separates solids of different sizes<br><br>
      <h6 class="question">Qquestion 2:</h6>
      What is winnowing? Where is it used?

      <h6 class="answer">Answer 2:</h6>


      The process of separating heavier and lighter components of a mixture by wind is called winnowing. This method is
      used by farmers to separate lighter husk particles from heavier seeds of grain. In this method, heavier and
      lighter components of a mixture are separated by wind.<br><br>

      <h6 class="question">Question 3:</h6>
      How will you separate husk or dirt particles from a given sample of pulses before cooking?

      <h6 class="answer">Answer 3:</h6>

      By the process of handpicking we can separated Husk and dirt particles from pulses .<br><br>

      <h6 class="question">Question 4:</h6>
      What is sieving? Where is it used?

      <h6 class="answer">Answer 4:</h6>
      Difference in the size of particles in a mixture is utilised to separate
      them by the process of sieving and filtration. Sieving is used in a flour mill to separate impurities like husk
      and stones from wheat before grinding it.<br><br>

      <h6 class="question">Question 5:</h6>
      How will you separate sand and water from their mixture?

      <h6 class="answer">Answer 5:</h6>

      In a mixture of sand and water,The mixture is allowed to stand without any disturbances. The heavier sand
      particles settle down at the bottom by the process of sedimentation and the water can be separated by decantation.
      Filtration can be used to separate components of a mixture of an insoluble solid and a liquid.<br><br>

      <h6 class="question">Question 6:</h6>
      Is it possible to separate sugar mixed with wheat flour? If yes, how will you do it?

      <h6 class="answer">Answer 6:</h6>

      Yes it is possible to separate sugar mixed with wheat flour by the process of sieving<br><br>




      <h6 class="question">Question 7:</h6>
      How would you obtain clear water from a sample of muddy water?
