               Explain why speed is important for survival in the grasslands for animals that live there.<br>
               (Hint: There are few trees or places for animals to hide in grasslands habitats).
               <h6 class="answer">Answer 8</h6>
               Due to lack trees or places for animals to hide in grassland for survival. When their predators(lion,
               tiger etc) attacks they have to run faster so as to reach a safe place. If they not run fast they lose
               their life. So, the speed is very important for survival of grassland animals.<br><br>
