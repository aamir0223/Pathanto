               <h5 class="question">Question 6</h5> When the current is switched on through a wire, a compass needle
               kept nearby gets deflected from its north-south position. Explain.</strong></p>
               <h6 class="answer">Answer </h6>
               <p>When ever current flow in wire it produce magnetic field around it So when we place compass near it
                    needle get deflect due that field.</p>
               <p>
               <h5 class="question">Question 7</h5> Will the compass needle show deflection when the switch in the
               circuit shown by Fig.14.24 is closed?</strong></p>

               <h6 class="answer">Answer </h6>
               <p>No , As circuit is not compelet so there in no flow of current it mean no magnetic field produce . If
                    there is no magnetic field then compass needle do not show deflection </p>

               bags from a garbage heap? Explain.</strong></p>
               <h6 class="answer">Answer </h6>
               <p>No, because plastic bags are not magnetic materials.It can not be attracted by magnet so magnet cannot
                    be used to separate plastic bags from a garbage heap.</p>

               <h5 class="question">Question 11</h5> An electrician is carrying out some repairs in your house. He wants
               to replace a fuse by a piece of wire. Would you agree? Give reasons for your response.</strong></p>
               <h6 class="answer">Answer </h6>
               <p>No ,It is not a good idea to replace fuse by a piece of wire because fuse has very low melting point
                    compare to wire.Whenever current get overload fuse melt and break the circuit to prevent short
                    circuits. </p>

               <h5 class="question">Question 12</h5> Zubeda made an electric circuit using a cell holder shown in Fig.
               14.4, a switch and a bulb. When she put the switch in the ‘ON’ position, the bulb did not glow. Help
               Zubeda in identifying the possible defects in the circuit.</strong></p>

               <h6 class="answer">Answer </h6>
               <p>the possible defects in the circuit may be bulb fused , may be wire should not connect properly,
                    switch not work properly etc If Zubeda will check these then may be bulb will glow. </p>
