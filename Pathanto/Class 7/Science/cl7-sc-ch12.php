<p><h5 class="question">Question 2</h5> Describe the different methods of asexual reproduction. Give examples.</strong><br />
<h6 class="answer">Answer </h6> The methods of asexual reproduction as follow <br />
(a) Fragmentation: organism breaks up into  two or more fragments. These fragments or pieces grow into new individuals.<br />

(b) Spore Formation:Spores are unicellular reproductive bodies present in sporangia. When Sporangia burst single-celled thin or thick walled structures called spores are obtained. Under favorable conditions, they develop into a new plant.<br />
(c) Budding:In yeast, The small bulb-like projection coming out from the yeast cell is called a bud. The bud gradually grows and bud gets detached from the parent cell and  forms a new yeast cell.<br />

(d) Vegetative propagation: Producing a new plant  using  vegetative parts of a plant like stems , leaves and root  is called vegetative propagation.</p>

<p><h5 class="question">Question 3</h5> Explain what you understand by sexual reproduction.</strong><br />
<h6 class="answer">Answer </h6>Sexual reproduction is the process in which new organisms are form, by combining  of  two  individuals.In this process male and female gametes fuse to form zygote. These zygotes develop into new individuals. .</p>
<p><strong><h5 class="question">Question 4</h5> State the main difference between asexual and sexual reproduction.</strong><br /></p>

<p><h5 class="question">Question 7</h5>How does the process of fertilization take place in flowers?</strong><br /></p>
 <h6 class="answer">Answer </h6>
 When the pollen lands on a suitable stigma, it has to reach the female germ-cells which are in the ovary. A tube grows
out of the pollen grain and travels through the style to reach the ovary, it releases the male gametes. A male gamete fuses with a female gamete in the ovule. This process is known as fertilisation<br>
<br>

<p><h5 class="question">Question 8</h5>.Describe the various ways by which seeds are dispersed.</strong><br /></p>
<h6 class="answer">Answer </h6>
 i) By Wind: light seeds of grasses or hairy seeds of aak (Madar) and hairy fruit of sunflower  get blown off with the wind 
 <br>
 ii)By water: These  fruits or seeds usually develop floating ability in the form of spongy or fibrous outer coat as in coconut
<br>
iii)By Animal : spiny seeds with hooks which get attached to the bodies of animals and are carried to distant places.<br>
