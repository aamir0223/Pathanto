<p><h5 class="question">Question 5</h5> The odometer of a car reads 57321.0 km when the clock shows the time 08:30 AM. What is the distance moved by the car, if at 08:50 AM, the odometer reading has changed to 57336.0 km? Calculate the speed of the car in km/min during this time. Express the speed in km/h also.</strong></p>
<h6 class="answer">Answer </h6>
<p>Initial reading  = 57321.0</p>
<p>Final reading  = 57336.0</p>
<p>time taken by car = 20 min</p>
<p>Distance covered by the car = Final reading  – Initial reading </p>
<p>= 57336.0 – 57321.0 = 15 km</p>
Speed = <div class="frac">
    <span> Distance  </span>

<p><h5 class="question">Question 6</h5> Salma takes 15 minutes from her house to reach her school on a bicycle. If the bicycle has a speed of 2 m/s, calculate the distance between her house and the school.</strong></p>
<h6 class="answer">Answer </h6>
<p>Time taken  = 15 mins= 15 x 60 = 900 s</p>
<p>Speed of  bicycle= 2m/s</p>
Speed = <div class="frac">

<p><h5 class="question">Question 8</h5>Which of the following relations is correct? </strong></p>
<p>(i) Speed = Distance × Time </strong></p>
<p>(ii) Speed = Distance/Time </strong></p>
<p>(iii) Speed = Time/Distance </strong></p>
<p>(iv) Speed = 1/Distance x Time</strong></p>
<h6 class="answer">Answer </h6>
<p> (ii) Speed = Distance/Time</p>
<p><h5 class="question">Question 9</h5>. The basic unit of speed is: </strong></p>
<p>(i) km/min </strong></p>
<p>(ii) m/min </strong></p>
<p>(iii) km/h </strong></p>
<p>(iv) m/s</strong></p>
<h6 class="answer">Answer </h6>
<p> (iv) m/s</p>
<p><h5 class="question">Question 10</h5> A car moves with a speed of 40 km/h for 15 minutes and then with a speed of 60 km/h for the next 15 minutes. The total distance covered by the car is: </strong></p>
<p>(i) 100 km (ii) 25 km (iii) 15 km (iv) 10 km</strong></p>
<h6 class="answer">Answer </h6>

<p>Speed = 40 km/h</strong></p>
<p>Time taken = 15 min = 15/60 = 0.25 h</p>
Speed = <div class="frac">
    <span> Distance  </span>
    <span class="symbol">/</span>
    <span class="bottom"> total time  </span>
    
</div>
<p>Distance covered (when speed is 40km/h) = speed x time </p>
<p>= 40 x 0.25 = 10 km</p>
<p>When the speed of the Car is 60 km/ h</p>
Speed = <div class="frac">
    <span> Distance  </span>
    <span class="symbol">/</span>
    <span class="bottom"> total time  </span>
    
</div>
<p>Distance covered (when speed is 60km/h)  = speed x time </p>
<p>= 60 x 0.25= 15 km</p>
<p>Total distance covered by the car =Distance covered (when speed is 40km/h) + Distance covered (when speed is 60km/h)</p>
<p>= 10 + 15 
= 25 km</p>
<p> So (ii) 25 km is correct</p>


<p><h5 class="question">Question 11</h5> Suppose the two photographs, shown in Fig. 13.1 and Fig. 13.2, had been taken at an interval of 10 seconds. If a distance of 100 metres is shown by 1 cm in these photographs, calculate the speed of the fastest car.</strong></p>
<img class="Q2ch3-5n" src="/Pathanto/image/cl7-sc-13-6.png" >
<h6 class="answer">Answer </h6>
Given 1cm = 100m<br>


Distance travelled by the blue car in the picture= 2 cm<br>
So 2 x 100 = 200 m<br>


<br>
Time taken = 10sec
<br>
Speed of the blue car =  <div class="frac">
    <span> Distance  </span>
    <span class="symbol">/</span>
    <span class="bottom"> total time  </span>
    
</div>
<br>= <div class="frac">

    <span class="symbol">/</span>
    <span class="bottom"> 10  </span>
    
</div> =20m/s<br>

So Speed of the blue car is  20  m/s<br>
