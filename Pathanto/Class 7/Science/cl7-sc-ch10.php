<p><h5 class="question">Question 1</h5> Why does an athlete breathe faster and deeper than usual after finishing the race?</strong></p>
<h6 class="answer">Answer </h6>
<p>During race athletes need a lot of energy.In order to  extra energy  the athlete breathes faster. Because more oxygen is supplied to our body for  breakdown of food so that it  released more energy .</p>

<p><h5 class="question">Question 2</h5> List the similarities and differences between aerobic and anaerobic respiration.</strong></p>
<h6 class="answer">Answer </h6>
<p>Similarities:<br>i) Both breakdown the food and released energy<br>ii) Both takes place inside cells</p>
<p>Differences</strong></p>

<p><h5 class="question">Question 3</h5> Why do we often sneeze when we inhale a lot of dust-laden air?</strong></p>
<h6 class="answer">Answer </h6>
<p>When we inhale dust-laden air the dust partical trap inside nostrill and irritate the mucus lining of the nasal cavity which results in sneezing.</p>
<p><h5 class="question">Question 4</h5> Take three test-tubes. Fill 3/4th of each with water. Label them A, B and C. Keep a snail in test-tube A, a water plant in test-tube B and in C, keep snail and plant both. Which test-tube would have the highest concentration of CO2 ?</strong></p>
<h6 class="answer">Answer </h6>
<p>Test tube A will have the highest concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> because snail which realease out CO<sub>2 </sub>into the tube and in tube B and tube C  there is a plant which will use  CO<sub>2 </sub>to  for making of food and realease O<sub>2</sub> so it have less concentration of  CO<sub>2</sub>  in the tube C.</p>
<p><h5 class="question">Question 5</h5> Tick the correct answer: </strong></p>
<p>(a) In cockroaches, air enters the body through </strong></p>
<p>(i) lungs (ii) gills (iii) spiracles (iv) skin </strong></p>
<p>(b) During heavy exercise, we get cramps in the legs due to the accumulation of </strong></p>

<p>(d) During exhalation, the ribs </strong></p>
