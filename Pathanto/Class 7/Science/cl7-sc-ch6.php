               <h6 class="question">Question 4</h6> When baking soda is mixed with lemon juice, bubbles are formed with
               the evolution of a gas. What type of change is it? Explain.</strong></p>

               <h6 class="answer">Answer </h6>
               <p>Carbon dioxide gas release When baking soda is mixed with lemon juice . This is a chemical change.</p>
               <p>Lemon juice + Baking soda → Carbon dioxide + other substances</p>

               <h6 class="question">Question 5</h6> When a candle burns, both physical and chemical changes take place.
               Identify these changes. Give another example of a familiar process in which both the chemical and
               physical changes take place.</strong></p>
               <h6 class="answer">Answer </h6>
               <p>Physical change is melting of wax and the chemical change is Burning of vapours of wax to give carbon
                    dioxide, heat and light. Burning of wood is a example of both physical and chemical change</p>

               <h6 class="question">Question 6</h6> How would you show that setting of curd is a chemical
               change?</strong></p>
               <h6 class="answer">Answer </h6>
               <p>The setting of curd is a chemical change because we can not get the original substance. As properties
                    of curd is different than milk.</p>

               <h6 class="question">Question 7</h6> Explain why burning of wood and cutting it into small pieces are
               considered as two different types of changes.</strong></p>
               <h6 class="answer">Answer </h6>
               <p>Cutting of wood is a physical change as no new substance is formed. On the other hand, burning of wood
                    is a chemical change as a new substance is formed like heat and CO<sub>2</sub> which is has
                    different properties than original wood</p>

               <p>Take a cupful of water in a beaker.
                    Add a few drops of dilute sulphuric acid to this.
                    Heat the water and when it starts boiling, add copper sulphate powder while still stirring.
                    Add the copper sulphate powder till no more powder can be dissolved. Filter the solution and leave
                    it cool

               rusting</strong></p>
               <h6 class="answer">Answer </h6>
               <p>Rusting of iron occure due to presence of moisture and oxygen. Painting prevents the iron gate from
                    coming in contact with oxygen and moisture </p>

               <p>
               <h6 class="question">Question 10</h6> Explain why rusting of iron objects is faster in coastal areas than
               in deserts.</strong></p>
               <h6 class="answer">Answer </h6>
               <p> As present of moisture in the air in coastal areas is higher than in the air in deserts . As we know
                    Rusting of iron occure due to presence of moisture and oxygen. hence, rusting of iron objects is
                    faster in coastal areas than in deserts.</p>
