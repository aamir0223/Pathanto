1.The graphs of y = p(x) are given in Fig. 2.10 below, for some polynomials p(x). Find the
number of zeroes of p(x), in each case<br>
<img class="Q2ch3-5n" src="/Pathanto/image/2-1.jpg"><br>.



(i)  the number of zeroes  is 0 because the graph is parallel to x-axis does not cut it at any point.<br>

(ii)  the number of zeroes  is 1 because the graph intersects the x-axis at only one point.
<br>
(iii)  the number of zeroes  is 3 because the graph intersects the x-axis at any three points.
<br>
(iv)  the number of zeroes  is 2 because the graph intersects the x-axis at two points.
<br>
(v)  the number of zeroes is 4 because the graph intersects the x-axis at four points.
<br>
(vi)  the number of zeroes  is 3 because the graph intersects the x-axis at three points.
