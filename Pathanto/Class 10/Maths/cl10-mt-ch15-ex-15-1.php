            </p>
            <p>(i) It is not have equally likely outcomes as the car may or may not start depending upon various factors
                like fuel or whether car state or not, etc.</p>
            <p>(ii) this statement does not have equally likely outcomes as it depends the player's ability or player

            <h6 class="question">Question 3</h6>
            Why is tossing a coin considered to be a fair way of deciding which team should get the ball at the
            beginning of a football game?
            </p>
            <h6 class="answer">Answer </h6>
            </p>
            <p>Tossing of a coin is a fair way of deciding because the number of possible outcomes are only 2 head or
                tail.So tossing is unpredictable and is considered to be completely fair.</p>

            <p>
            <h6 class="question">Question 4</h6>
            Which of the following cannot be the probability of an event?
            </p>
            <p>(A) 2/3 (B) -1.5 (C) 15% (D) 0.7
            </p>
            <h6 class="answer">Answer </h6>
            </p>
            <p>the above option (B) -1.5 cannot be the probability of an event.As probability lie between 1 and 0</p>

            <p>
            <h6 class="question">Question 5</h6> If P(E) = 0.05, what is the probability of ‘not E’?
            </p>
            <h6 class="answer">Answer </h6>
            </p>
            <p> Here We know that,</p>
            <p>P(E)+P(not E) = 1</p>
            <p>P(E) = 0.05</p>
            <p> P(not E) = 1-P(E)</p>
            <p> P(not E) = 1-0.05</p>
            <p>∴ P(not E) = 0.95</p>

            <p>(i) an orange flavored candy?
            </p>
            <p>(ii) a lemon flavored candy?
            </p>
            <h6 class="answer">Answer </h6>
            </p>


            <p>i) Number of orange flavored candies in the = 0</p>
            <p>∴ The probability of orange flavored candies = 0/1 = 0</p>

            students not having the same birthday is 0.992. What is the probability that the 2 students have the same
            birthday?
            </p>
            <h6 class="answer">Answer </h6>
            </p>

            <p>Given, P(E) = 0.992</p>
            <p>We know that </p>
            <p>P(E)+P(not E) = 1</p>
            <p>Or, P(not E) = 1–0.992 = 0.008</p>
            <p>∴ The probability that the 2 students have the same birthday is 0.008</p>

            <h6 class="answer">Answer </h6>
            <p>(i)Numbers of defective bulbs = 4</p>
            <p>The total numbers of bulbs = 20</p>

            </p>
            <p>(i) 5 will not come up either time?
            </p>
            <p>(ii) 5 will come up at least once?</p>
            <p>[Hint : Throwing a die twice and throwing two dice simultaneously are treated as the same experiment]

            <h6 class="answer">Answer </h6>
            </p>
            <p>Outcomes are:</p>
            <p>(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6)</p>
            <p>(2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6)</p>
            <p>(3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6)</p>
            <p>(4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)</p>
            <p>(5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)</p>
            <p>(6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)</p>
            <p>So, the total number of outcome = 6×6 = 36</p>
            <p>(i) <strong>Method 1:</strong>
            </p>

            <p>P(5 comes in first throw) = 6/36,</p>
            <p>P( comes in second throw) = 6/36 and</p>
            <p>P(not B) = 5/6</p>
            <p>So, P(not A) = 1-(6/36) = 5/6</p>
            <p>∴ The required probability = (5/6)×(5/6) = 25/36</p>

            <p>(ii) Number of events when 5 comes at least once = 11 </p>
            <p>∴ The r probability = 11/36</p>

            <h6 class="question">Question 25</h6> Which of the following arguments are correct and which are not
            correct? Give reasons for your Solution:
            </p>
            <p>(i) If two coins are tossed simultaneously there are three possible outcomes—two heads, two tails or one
                of each. Therefore, for each of these outcomes, the probability is 1/3
            </p>
            <p>(ii) If a die is thrown, there are two possible outcomes—an odd number or an even number. Therefore, the
                probability of getting an odd number is 1/2
            </p>
            <h6 class="answer">Answer </h6>
            <p>(i) All the possible events are (H,H); (H,T); (T,H) and (T,T)</p>
            <p>So, P ( heads) = 1/4= 0.25</p>
            <p>and, P (getting one of the each) = 2/4 = 1/2 = 0.5 </p>
            <p>∴ This statement is incorrect.</p>
            <p>(ii)Since the two outcomes are equally likely,<br> this statement is correct.</p>
