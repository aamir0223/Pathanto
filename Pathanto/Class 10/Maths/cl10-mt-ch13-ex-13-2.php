               <h6 class="question">Question 1</h6>. A solid is in the shape of a cone standing on a hemisphere with
               both their radii being equal to 1 cm and the height of the cone is equal to its radius. Find the volume
               of the solid in terms of π.</p>

               <p>Here r = 1 cm and h = 1 cm.</p>

               <p>Now, Volume of solid = Volume of conical part + Volume of hemispherical part</p>
               <p>We know taht volume of cone = (1/3)πr<sup>2</sup>h</p>
               <p>And,</p>
               <p>The volume of hemisphere = (2/3)πr<sup>3</sup></p>
               <p>So, volume of solid will be</p>
               <p> (1/3)π(1)<sup>2</sup>[1 + 2(1)]cm<sup>3</sup> =(1/3)π x 1 x [3]cm<sup>3</sup></p>

               <h6 class="question">Question 2</h6>.
               Rachel, an engineering student, was asked to make a model shaped like a cylinder with two cones attached
               at its two ends by using a thin aluminum sheet. The diameter of the model is 3 cm and its length is 12
               cm. If each cone has a height of 2 cm, find the volume of air contained in the model that Rachel made.
               (Assume the outer and inner dimensions of the model to be nearly the same.)</p>
               <h6 class="answer">Answer 2</h6>.
               <p>Given,</p>
               <p>Height of cylinder = 12–4 = 8 cm</p>
               <p>Radius = 1.5 cm</p>
               <p>Height of cone = 2 cm</p>
               <p>Now, the total volume of the air contained will be = Volume of cylinder+2×(Volume of cone)</p>
               <p>∴ Total volume = πr<sup>2</sup>h+[2×(⅓ πr<sup>2</sup>h )]
               <p>= 18 π+2(1.5 π)</p>
               <p>= 66 cm<sup>3</sup>.</p>

               <h6 class="question">Question 3</h6> A Gulab jamun contains sugar syrup up to about 30% of its volume.
               Find approximately how much syrup would be found in 45 Gulab jamuns, each shaped like a cylinder with two
               hemispherical ends with length 5 cm and diameter 2.8 cm (see figure).</strong></p>

                    alt="NCERT Ex-13.2 class 10"><br>
               <h6 class="answer">Answer 3</h6>.

               <p>So, the total height of a gulab jamun = 5 cm.</p>
               <p>Diameter = 2.8 cm</p>
               <p>So, radius = 1.4 cm</p>
               <p>∴ The height of the cylindrical part = 5 cm–(1.4+1.4) cm</p>
               <p>=2.2 cm</p>
               <p>Now, volume of One Gulab Jamun = Volume of Cylinder + Volume of two hemispheres</p>
               <p>= πr<sup>2</sup>h+(4/3)πr<sup>3</sup></p>
               <p>= 4.312π+(10.976/3) π</p>
               <p>= 25.05 cm<sup>3</sup></p>
               <p>volume of sugar syrup = 30% of total volume</p>
               <p>So, volume of sugar syrup in 45 gulab jamuns = 45×30%(25.05 cm<sup>3</sup>)</p>
               <p>= 45×7.515 = 338.184 cm<sup>3</sup></p>

               <h6 class="question">Question 4</h6> A pen stand made of wood is in the shape of a cuboid with four
               conical depressions to hold pens. The dimensions of the cuboid are 15 cm by 10 cm by 3.5 cm. The radius
               of each of the depressions is 0.5 cm and the depth is 1.4 cm. Find the volume of wood in the entire stand
               (see Fig.).</strong></p>
               <img class="Q2ch3-5n" src="https://pathanto.com/Pathanto/image/ex13.2-6.png" alt="NCERT Ex-13.2 class 10"
                    width="250" height="200"><br>

               <h6 class="answer">Answer </h6>.
               <p>Volume of cuboid = length x width x height</p>
               <p> length = 15cm <br> width = 10cm <br>height =3.5cm </p>
               <p>So, the volume of the cuboid = 15x10x3.5 = 525 cm<sup>3</sup></p>
               <p>Given, radius r = 0.5 cm and height h = 1.4 cm</p>
               <p>Here, volume of conical depressions </p>
               <p> = (1/3)πr<sup>2</sup>h</p>

               <p>∴ Volume of 4 cones = 4x(1/3)πr<sup>2</sup>h</p>
               <p>= 1.46 cm<sup>2</sup></p>
               <p>Now, volume of wood = Volume of cuboid – 4 x volume of cone</p>
               <p>= 525-1.46 = 523.54 cm<sup>2</sup></p>

               <h6 class="question">Question 5</h6> A vessel is in the form of an inverted cone. Its height is 8 cm and
               the radius of its top, which is open, is 5 cm. It is filled with water up to the brim. When lead shots,
               each of which is a sphere of radius 0.5 cm are dropped into the vessel, one-fourth of the water flows
               out. Find the number of lead shots dropped in the vessel.</p>
               <h6 class="answer">Answer 5</h6>
               <img class="Q2ch3-5n" src="https://pathanto.com/Pathanto/image/ex13.2-2.png" alt="NCERT Ex-13.2 class 10"
                    width="250" height="200"><br>
               <p>For the cone,</p>
               <p>Radius = 5 cm,</p>
               <p>Height = 8 cm</p>
               <p>Also,</p>
               <p>Radius of sphere = 0.5 cm</p>

               <p> volume of water in vessel</p>
               <p> =(1/3) x π x r<sup>2</sup> x h</p>
               <p> (1/3) x (22/7) x 5 x 5 x 8<br>=(4400/21)cm<sup>3</sup> </p>

               <p>Volume of lead shot</p>
               <p>= (4/3)πr<sup>3 </sup></p>
               <p>= (1/6) x (22 /7) = (11/21)cm<sup>3</sup> </p>
               <p> let n is the number of lead shots dropped in the vessel</p>

               <p> So, <br> n x volume of water in vessel = (1/4) x volume of water in vessel </p>
               <p> n x (11/21) = (4400/21 ) x (1/4) <br> = n x 11 =1100 <br> n=100</p>
               <p> So the number of lead shots =100</p>

               <h6 class="question">Question 6</h6> A solid iron pole consists of a cylinder of height 220 cm and base
               diameter 24 cm, which is surmounted by another cylinder of height 60 cm and radius 8 cm. Find the mass of
               the pole, given that 1 cm<sup>3</sup> of iron has approximately 8 g mass.</p>
               <h6 class="answer">Answer 6</h6>.

               <p>Given, the height of the big cylinder H = 220 cm</p>
               <p>Radius of the base R = 24/12 = 12 cm</p>
               <p>Now, the height of smaller cylinder (h) = 60 cm</p>
               <p>Radius of the base (r) = 8 cm</p>
               <p>So, the volume of the smaller cylinder = πr<sup>2</sup>h</p>
               <p>= π(8)2×60 cm<sup>3</sup></p>
               <p>= 12068.5 cm<sup>3</sup></p>
               <p>∴ Volume of iron pole = Volume of the big cylinder+ Volume of the small cylinder</p>
               <p>= 99565.8 + 12068.5</p>
               <p>=111634.5 cm<sup>3</sup></p>
               <p>We know,</p>
               <p>Mass = Density x volume</p>
               <p>So, mass of the pole = 8×111634.5</p>
               <p>= 893.26 Kg </p>
