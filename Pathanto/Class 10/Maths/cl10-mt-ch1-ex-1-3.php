<h6 class="question">Question 1</h6>
 Prove that √5 is irrational.<br>


<h6 class="answer">Answer 1</h6> 
Let us assume, that √5 is rational number.<br>

 √5 = <div class="frac">
    <span>a</span>
    <span class="symbol">/</span>
    <span class="bottom">b </span>
    
</div>.. where, a and b are co-primes<br>

b√5= a<br>
  On squaring both the sides, <br>

(b√5)<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup><br>

b<sup>2</sup> =
<div class="frac">
    <span> a<sup>2</sup></span>
    <span class="symbol">/</span>
    <span class="bottom">5</span></div><br>

 a<sup>2</sup> is divisible by 5,<br>
  'a' is also divisible by 5.<br>

Let  'a' = 5c, <br>

5b<sup>2</sup> = (5c)<sup>2</sup><br>

b<sup>2</sup> = 5c<sup>2</sup><br>
c<sup>2</sup> =
<div class="frac">
    <span> b<sup>2</sup></span>
    <span class="symbol">/</span>
    <span class="bottom">5</span></div><br>

 b<sup>2</sup> is divisible by 5 <br>
  'b' is divisible by 5.<br>

this implies that a and b have 5 as common factor.
And this is a contradiction to the fact that a and b are co-prime .
So our assumption about  is rational is incorrect.<br>

Hence, √5 is irrational number.<br>

<h6 class="question">Question 2</h6>
 Prove that 3 + 2√5 + is irrational.

<h6 class="answer">Answer 2</h6> 
 Let us assume 3 + 2√5 is rational.<br>

Then we can find co-prime a and b (b ≠ 0) such that 3 + 2√5 = 
 <div class="frac">
    <span>a</span>
    <span class="symbol">/</span>
    <span class="bottom">b </span>
    
</div><br>

   2√5=  <div class="frac">
    <span>a</span>
    <span class="symbol">/</span>
    <span class="bottom">b </span>
    
</div> -3<br>

       2√5=<div class="frac">
    <span>1</span>
    <span class="symbol">/</span>
    <span class="bottom">2 </span>
    
</div> (
<div class="frac">
    <span>a</span>
    <span class="symbol">/</span>
    <span class="bottom">b </span>
    
</div> -3)<br>



Since a and b are integers  

       <div class="frac">
    <span>1</span>
    <span class="symbol">/</span>
    <span class="bottom">2 </span>
    
</div> (
<div class="frac">
    <span>a</span>
    <span class="symbol">/</span>
    <span class="bottom">b </span>
    
</div> -3)

 will also be rational number 

Therefore, √5 is also a rational number. But this contradicts the fact that √5 is irrational.<br>

So, we conclude that 3 + 2√5 is irrational.<br>

<h6 class="question">Question 3</h6>
 Prove that the following are irrationals:<br>

(i) <div class="frac">
    <span>1</span>
    <span class="symbol">/</span>
    <span class="bottom">√2 </span>
    </div>

(ii) 7√5<br>

(iii) 6 + √2<br>

<h6 class="answer">Answer 3</h6> 

(i) 1/√2<br>

 Let us assume   <div class="frac">
    <span>1</span>
    <span class="symbol">/</span>
    <span class="bottom">√2 </span>
    </div>
      is rational.<br>

Then we can find co-prime a and b (b ≠ 0) such that <div class="frac">
    <span>1</span>
    <span class="symbol">/</span>
    <span class="bottom">√2 </span>
    </div> = 
 <div class="frac">
    <span>a</span>
    <span class="symbol">/</span>
    <span class="bottom">b </span>
    
</div><br>

  √2 =  <div class="frac">
    <span>b</span>
    <span class="symbol">/</span>
    <span class="bottom">a </span>
    
</div><br> 

      


Since a and b are integers  

       
<div class="frac">
    <span>a</span>
    <span class="symbol">/</span>
    <span class="bottom">b </span>
    
</div> 

 will also be rational number 

Therefore,  √2 is also a rational number. But this contradicts the fact that  √2  is irrational.<br>

So, we conclude that  √2  is irrational.<br>

<br>

(ii) 7√5<br>

Let us assume   7√5
      is rational.<br>

Then we can find co-prime a and b (b ≠ 0) such that 7√5 = 
 <div class="frac">
    <span>a</span>
    <span class="symbol">/</span>
    <span class="bottom">b </span>
    
</div><br>

√5 =  <div class="frac">
    <span>1a</span>
    <span class="symbol">/</span>
    <span class="bottom">7b</span>
    
</div><br> 

      


Since a and b are integers  

       
 <div class="frac">
    <span>1a</span>
    <span class="symbol">/</span>
    <span class="bottom">7b</span>
    
</div> 

 will also be rational number 

Therefore,  √5 is also a rational number. But this contradicts the fact that √5  is irrational.<br>

So, we conclude that  7√5  is irrational.<br>
<br>
(iii) 6 +√2<br>


Then we can find co-prime a and b (b ≠ 0) such that 6 +√2 = 
 <div class="frac">
    <span>a</span>
    <span class="symbol">/</span>
    <span class="bottom">b </span>
    
</div><br>

√2 =  <div class="frac">
    <span>1a</span>
    <span class="symbol">/</span>
    <span class="bottom">7b</span>
    
</div> - 6<br> 

      


Since a and b are integers  

       
 <div class="frac">
    <span>a</span>
    <span class="symbol">/</span>
    <span class="bottom">b</span>
    
</div> - 6

 will also be rational number 

Therefore,  √2 is also a rational number. But this contradicts the fact that √2  is irrational.<br>

So, we conclude that 6 +√2  is irrational.<br>
