               <h6 class="question">Question 1</h6>. A copper wire, 3 mm in diameter, is wound about a cylinder whose
               length is 12 cm, and diameter 10 cm, so as to cover the curved surface of the cylinder. Find the length
               and mass of the wire, assuming the density of copper to be 8.88 g per cm<sup>3</sup></p>
               <h6 class="answer">Answer </h6>

               Diameter of cylinder = 10 cm<br>
               Radius of the cylinder r =<img class="Q2ch3-5n A" src="https://pathanto.com/Pathanto/image/A.jpg"> = 5 cm
               <br>
               ∴ Length of wire in one round = 2πr = 2π x 5 cm = 10 π cm <br>
               diameter of wire = 3 mm =3/10 = 0.3 cm <br>
               ∴ The thickness of cylinder = 3/10 m <br>
               Hence, the number of turns will be- length of wire required to complete 40 rounds = 40 x 10 π cm =
               1257.14 cm <br>
               Radius of the wire = cm= 0.15 cm <br>
               Volume of wire = Area of cross-section of wire × Length of wire<br>
               =π(0.15)<sup>2</sup> ×1257.14<br>
               = 88.898 cm3 <br>
               Mass = Volume × Density
               = 88.898×8.88 <br>
               = 789.41 gm<br>

               = 789.41 gm

               <h6 class="question">Question 3</h6>. A cistern, internally measuring 150 cm × 120 cm × 100 cm, has
               129600 cm<sup>3</sup> of water in it. Porous bricks are placed in the water until the cistern is full to
               the brim. Each brick absorbs one-seventeenth of its own volume of water. How many bricks can be put in
               without overflowing the water, each being 22.5 cm × 7.5 cm × 6.5 cm?</p>
               <h6 class="answer">Answer </h6>

               Dimension of the cistern = 150 × 120 × 110<br>
               volume of the cistern = 1980000 cm<sup>3</sup><br>
               Volume to be filled in cistern = 1980000 – 129600 = 1850400 cm<sup>3</sup><br>
               Let n number of bricks placed in cistern<br>
               volume of n bricks will be = n×22.5×7.5×6.5 =1096.875n<br>

               <h6 class="question">Question 4</h6> In one fortnight of a given month, there was a rainfall of 10 cm in
               a river valley. If the area of the valley is 7280 km<sup>2</sup>, show that the total rainfall was
               approximately equivalent to the addition to the normal water of three rivers each 1072 km long, 75 m wide
               and 3 m deep.</strong></p>
               <h6 class="answer">Answer </h6>

               Rainfall in the rivers= 10cm =0.1m<br>
               Area of river= 97280km<sup>2</sup> =7280000000m<sup>2</sup><br>
               Volume of water= 7280000000 x 0.1 = 728000000m<sup>3</sup><br>
               Now, volume of 3 rivers = 3 × 1072000 x 75 x 3 = 3 x 24100000 = 843600000 m<sup>3</sup><br>
               728000000m<sup>3</sup> ≠ 843600000 m<sup>3</sup>
               So, the question statement is false.
