<h6 class="answer">Answer</h6>

Let P(x, y) be the required point.<br>the  section formula x=ss
<div class="frac">

 So x<sub>1</sub> = -1 , x<sub>2</sub> =4 ,y<sub>1</sub>=7 ,y<sub>2</sub>= -3

 the point is (1, 3)<br>

<h6 class="question">Question 2</h6>. Find the coordinates of the points of trisection of the line segment joining (4, -1) and (-2, -3).<br>

<h6 class="answer">Answer</h6>


<img class="Q2ch3-5n" src="https://pathanto.com/Pathanto/image/7-2-1.jpeg" alt="ex 7.2 NCERT class 10 "><br>.
Here Let assume P (x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>) and Q(x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>22</sub>) are the points of trisection so  AP = PQ = QB

 1:2.
 here we know <br>
x =<div class="frac">
    <span> (m<sub>1</sub> x<sub>2</sub> + m<sub>2</sub> x<sub>1</sub> )</span>
    <span class="symbol">/</span>
    <span class="bottom">m<sup>1</sup> + m<sup>2</sup></span>
    
 </div> <br>
 y = <div class="frac">
    <span> (m<sub>1</sub> y<sub>2</sub> + m<sub>2</sub> y<sub>1</sub> )</span>
    <span class="symbol">/</span>
    <span class="bottom">m<sup>1</sup> + m<sup>2</sup></span>
    
 </div> <br>


x<sub>1</sub> = <div class="frac">
    <span> (1 × (-2) + 2 × 4)</span>
    <span class="symbol">/</span>
    <span class="bottom"> 1+ 2 </span>
    
 </div> <br> = (-2+8)/3 = 6/3 = 2<br>

y<sub>1</sub> =<div class="frac">
    <span>(1×(-3)+2×(-1))</span>
    <span class="symbol">/</span>
    <span class="bottom">(1+2)</span>
    
 </div> <br> = (-3-2)/3 = -5/3<br>

Therefore: P (x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>) = P(2, -5/3)

Point Q divides AB internally in the ratio 2:1.

x<sub>2</sub> = <div class="frac">
    <span>(2×(-2)+1×4)</span>

    <span class="symbol">/</span>
    <span class="bottom">(2+1)</span>

<h6 class="question">Question 3</h6> To conduct Sports Day activities, in your rectangular shaped school ground ABCD, lines have been drawn with chalk powder at a distance of 1 m each. 100 flower pots have been placed at a distance of 1 m from each other along AD, as shown in the following figure. Niharika runs 1/4 th the distance AD on the 2nd line and posts a green flag. Preet runs 1/5th the distance AD on the eighth line and posts a red flag. What is the distance between both the flags? If Rashmi has to post a blue flag exactly halfway between the line segment joining the two flags, where should she post her flag?<br>
<img class="Q2ch3-5n" src="https://pathanto.com/Pathanto/image/7-2-3.png" alt="ex 7.2 NCERT class 10 "><br>.

<h6 class="answer">Answer</h6>
 we observed that Niharika posted the green flag at 1/4th of the distance AD i.e., (1/4 ×100) m = 25m from the starting point of 2nd line. Therefore, the coordinates of this point are (2, 25).<br>

Similarly, Preet posted red flag at 1/5 of the distance AD i.e., (1/5 ×100) m = 20m from the starting point of 8th line. Therefore, the coordinates of this point are (8, 20).<br>

Distance between these flags  <img class="Q2ch3-5n" src="https://pathanto.com/Pathanto/image/7-2-3-ii.png" alt="ex 7.2 NCERT class 10 "><br>.



The point at which Rashmi should post her blue flag is the mid- point of the line joining these points. Let say this point be B(x, y).<br>

x = (2+8)/2 = 10/2 = 5 <br> y = (20+25)/2 = 45/2<br>

 B( x, y) = (5,45/2)<br>

Therefore, Rashmi should post her blue flag at 45/2 = 22.5m on 5th line.<br>

<h6 class="question">Question 4</h6> Find the ratio in which the line segment joining the points (-3, 10) and (6, – 8) is divided by (-1, 6).
<br>
<h6 class="answer">Answer</h6>
<br>
Let assume  the ratio in which the line segment joining ( -3, 10) and (6, -8) is divided by point ( -1, 6) be k :1.
<br>
So ,  -1 = <div class="frac">
    <span>( 6k-3)</span>
    <span class="symbol">/</span>
    <span class="bottom">(k+1)</span>
    
 </div> <br>
<br>
–k – 1 = 6k -3
<br>
7k = 2
<br>
k = 2/7
<br>
Therefore, the required ratio is 2:7.
<br>
<h6 class="question">Question 5</h6> Find the ratio in which the line segment joining A (1, – 5) and B (- 4, 5) is divided by the x-axis. Also find the coordinates of the point of division.
<br>
<h6 class="answer">Answer</h6>
<br>
Let the ratio in which the line segment joining A (1, – 5) and B ( – 4, 5) is divided by x-axis be k : 1.<br>
 Therefore, the coordinates of the point of division, say Q(x, y) is 
 <div class="frac">
    <span> (-4k+1) </span>
    <span class="symbol">/</span>
    <span class="bottom"> (k+1)</span>
    
 </div>,
 <div class="frac">
    <span> (5k-5)</span>
    <span class="symbol">/</span>
    <span class="bottom"> (k+1)</span>
    
 </div>.
<br>


We know that y-coordinate of any point on x-axis is 0.
<br>
Therefore, <div class="frac">
    <span> (5k-5)</span>
    <span class="symbol">/</span>
    <span class="bottom"> (k+1)</span>
    
 </div> = 0
<br>
5k = 5
<br>
or k = 1
<br>
So, x-axis divides the line segment in the ratio 1:1.
<br>
 the point of division:
<br>
Q (x, y) =<div class="frac">
    <span> (-4(1) + 1) </span>

<h6 class="question">Question 6</h6> If (1, 2), (4, y), (x, 6) and (3, 5) are the vertices of a parallelogram taken in order, find x and y.
<br>
<h6 class="answer">Answer</h6>
<br>
Let A,B,C and D be the vertex of a parallelogram : A(1,2), B(4,y), C(x,6) and D(3,5). and O is intersection point of diagonal AC and BD
<br>
<img class="Q2ch3-5n" src="https://pathanto.com/Pathanto/image/7-2-6.jpeg" alt="ex 7.2 NCERT class 10 "><br>.
<br>
Since  O is the midpoint of AC and BD .
<br>
Midpoint of AC <br>= ( (1+x)/2 , (2+6)/2 ) = ((1+x)/2 , 4)
<br>
Midpoint of BD<br> = ((4+3)/2 , (5+y)/2 ) = (7/2 , (5+y)/2)
<br>
Midpoint of AC and BD are same
<br>
(1+x)/2 = 7/2 and 4 = (5+y)/2
<br>
x + 1 = 7 and 5 + y = 8
<br>
x = 6 and y = 3. 
<br>
<h6 class="question">Question 7</h6> Find the coordinates of a point A, where AB is the diameter of circle whose centre is (2, – 3) and B is (1,4).
<br>
<h6 class="answer">Answer</h6>
<br>
Let the coordinates of point A be (x, y).
<br>
Mid-point of AB is (2, – 3), which is the centre of the circle.
<br>
Coordinate of B = (1, 4)
<br>
(2, -3) =((x+1)/2 , (y+4)/2)
<br>
(x+1)/2 = 2 and (y+4)/2 = -3
<br>
x + 1 = 4 and y + 4 = -6
<br>
x = 3 and y = -10
<br>
The coordinates of A(3,-10).
<br>
<h6 class="question">Question 8</h6> If A and B are (-2, -2) and (2, -4), respectively, find the coordinates of P such that AP = 3/7 AB and P lies on the line segment AB.

<br>
<img class="Q2ch3-5n" src="https://pathanto.com/Pathanto/image/7-2-8.jpeg" alt="ex 7.2 NCERT class 10 "><br>.
<br>
The coordinates of point A and B are (-2,-2) and (2,-4) respectively. Since AP = 3/7 AB
<br>
Therefore, AP: PB = 3:4
<br>
Point P divides the line segment AB in the ratio 3:4.
