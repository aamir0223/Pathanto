<h6 class="question">Question 1</h6>
 Use Euclid’s division algorithm to find the HCF of:<br>

i. 135 and 225 <br>

ii. 196 and 38220<br>

iii. 867 and 225<br>

<h6 class="answer">Answer 1</h6>

i. 135 and 225<br>
 225 is greater than 135. Therefore, by Euclid’s division algorithm <br>

225 = 135 × 1 + 90<br>

remainder 90 ≠ 0, Again<br>

135 = 90 × 1 + 45<br>

Again, 45 ≠ 0,<br>
90 = 45 × 2 + 0<br>

The remainder is now zero  in the last step, the divisor is 45.<br>

Hence, the HCF of 225 and 135 is 45.<br><br>

ii. 196 and 38220<br>
 38220>196, <br>
 therefore the by applying Euclid’s division algorithm and taking 38220 as divisor,<br>

38220 = 196 × 195 + 0<br>

 remainder as 0 here So <br>

Hence, the HCF of 196 and 38220 is 196.<br><br>

iii. 867 and 225<br>

 867 is greater than 225. Now apply now Euclid’s division algorithm on 867, <br>

867 = 225 × 3 + 102<br>

 Again Remainder 102 ≠ 0,<br>
 
225 = 102 × 2 + 51<br>

Again, 51 ≠ 0. <br>


102 = 51 × 2 + 0<br>

The remainder is now zero  in the last step, the divisor is 51,<br>

Hence, the HCF of 867 and 225 is 51.<br><br>

<h6 class="question ">Question 2</h6>
 Show that any positive odd integer is of the form 6q + 1, or 6q + 3, or 6q + 5, where q is some integer.<br>

<h6 class="answer ">Answer 2</h6>

Let a be any positive integer and b = 6. <br>
by Euclid’s algorithm,<br> a = 6q + r, where  q ≥ 0, and r = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, because 0≤r<6.<br>


If r = 0, then a = 6q<br>

Similarly, for r= 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, the value of a is 6q+1, 6q+2, 6q+3, 6q+4 and 6q+5, respectively.

here a = 6q, 6q+2, 6q+4, <br>
 a is an even number and divisible by 2. A positive integer can be either even or odd Therefore, any positive odd integer is of the form of 6q+1, 6q+3 and 6q+5, where q is some integer.<br><br>

<h6 class="question ">Question 3</h6>
 An army contingent of 616 members is to march behind an army band of 32 members in a parade. The two groups are to march in the same number of columns. What is the maximum number of columns in which they can march?<br>

<h6 class="answer ">Answer 3</h6>



Number of army contingent members=616<br>

Number of army band members = 32<br>

 The maximum number of columns in which they can march=HCF(616, 32).<br>

By Using Euclid’s algorithm to find their HCF, we get,<br>

Since, 616>32, <br>

616 = 32 × 19 + 8<br>

Since, 8 ≠ 0, therefore, taking 32 as new divisor<br>

32 = 8 × 4 + 0<br>

Now we have got remainder as 0 So,HCF (616, 32) = 8.<br>

Hence, the maximum number of columns in which they can march is 8.<br><br>

<h6 class="question ">Question 4</h6>
 Use Euclid’s division lemma to show that the square of any positive integer is either of the form 3m or 3m + 1 for some integer m.

<h6 class="answer ">Answer 4</h6>

Let 'a' be any positive integer and b = 3.<br>



So, a= 3q + r for some integer q≥0 and <br>r = 0, 1, 2, as r ≥ 0 and r < 3.<br>

Or a  = 3q, 3q+1 and 3q+2<br>

 by squaring both the sides, we get,<br>

a<sup>2</sup> = (3q)<sup>2</sup> or (3q +1)<sup>2</sup> <br>
=(9q<sup>2</sup>) or 9q<sup>2</sup> + 6q +1<br>

Let 3q<sup>2</sup> = k<br>

Therefore, a<sup>2</sup>= 3k  .........(i)or<br>

a<sup>2</sup> = (3q + 1)<sup>2</sup> = (3q)<sup>2</sup>+1<sup>2</sup>+2×3q×1 = 9q<sup>2</sup> + 1 +6q = 3(3q<sup>2</sup>+2q) +1
 3q<sup>2</sup>+2q =k <br>

a<sup>2</sup>= 3k + 1 .........(ii)<br>

a<sup>2</sup>= (3q + 2)<sup>2</sup> = (3q)<sup>2</sup>+2<sup>2</sup>+2×3q×2 = 9q<sup>2</sup> + 4 + 12q = 3 (3q<sup>2</sup> + 4q + 1)+1<br>

Again,3q<sup>2</sup> + 4q + 1 = k,<br>

a<sup>2</sup>= 3k + 1.....................(iii)<br>

 from equation i,ii and iii, <br>we can say that, the square of any positive integer is either of the form 3m or 3m + 1 for some integer m.<br>

<h6 class="question ">Question 5</h6>
 Use Euclid’s division lemma to show that the cube of any positive integer is of the form 9m, 9m + 1 or 9m + 8.<br>

<h6 class="answer ">Answer 5</h6>

Let a be any positive integer and b= 3.

By Euclid’s division algorithm, then,

a = 3q+r, where q≥0 and r = 0, 1, 2, as r ≥ 0 and r < 3.

Therefore, putting the value of r,<br>

q = 3q <br>

or<br>

 3q + 1<br>

or<br>

 3q + 2<br>

Now, by taking the cube of all<br> 

Case (i): When r = 0, then,<br>

a<sup>3</sup>= (3q)<sup>3</sup> = 27q<sup>3</sup>= 9(3q<sup>3</sup>)= 9m; where m = 3q<sup>3</sup><br>

Case (ii): When r = 1, then,<br>

a<sup>3</sup> = (3q+1)<sup>3</sup> = (3q)<sup>3</sup> +1<sup>3</sup>+3×3q×1(3q+1) = 27q<sup>3</sup>+1+27q<sup>2</sup>+9q<br>


x<sup>3</sup> = 9(3q<sup>3</sup>+3q<sup>2</sup>+q)+1<br>

Putting = m, we get,<br>

Putting (3q<sup>3</sup>+3q<sup>3</sup>+q) = m, we get ,<br>

a<sup>3</sup> = 9m+1<br>

Case (iii): When r = 2, then,<br>

a<sup>3</sup> = (3q+2)<sup>3</sup>= (3q)<sup>3</sup>+2<sup>3</sup>+3×3q×2(3q+2) = 27q<sup>3</sup>+54q<sup>2</sup>+36q+8<br>


a<sup>3</sup>=9(3q<sup>3</sup>+6q<sup>2</sup>+4q)+8<br>

Putting (3q<sup>3</sup>+6q<sup>2</sup>+4q) = m<br>

a<sup>3</sup>= 9m+8<br>

 it is proved that the cube of any positive integer is of the form 9m, 9m + 1 or 9m + 8.<br>
