               <h6 class="question">Question 1</h6> Find the distance between the following pairs of points:<br>

               (i) (2, 3), (4, 1)<br>

               (ii) (-5, 7), (-1, 3)<br>

               (iii) (a, b), (- a, – b)<br>

               <h6 class="answer">Answer</h6>

               Distance between two points (x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>) and (x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>) is <br>

               <h6 class="question">Question 2</h6> Find the distance between the points (0, 0) and (36, 15). Can you
               now find the distance between the two towns A and B discussed in Section 7.2.

               <h6 class="answer">Answer</h6>

               Distance between points (0, 0) and (36, 15)<br>

               =39
               The distance between town A and B will be 39 km.<br>

               <h6 class="question">Question 3</h6>. Determine if the points (1, 5), (2, 3) and (-2, -11) are
               collinear.<br>

               <h6 class="answer">Answer 3</h6> In collinear AB + BC = CA<br>

               A = (1, 5) B = (2, 3) and C = (-2, -11)<br>

               <img class="Q2ch3-5n" src="https://pathanto.com/Pathanto/image/7-1-3.png"
                    alt="NCERT Ex-7.1 class 10"><br>.



               Hrer AB + BC ≠ CA<br>

               So the points (1, 5), (2, 3), and ( – 2, – 11) are not collinear.<br>

               <h6 class="question">Question 4</h6> Check whether (5, – 2), (6, 4) and (7, – 2) are the vertices of an
               isosceles triangle.<br>

               <h6 class="answer">Answer</h6>
               Since two sides of any isosceles triangle are equal.<br>

               Let the three point of triangle are A(5, – 2), B(6, 4), and C(7, – 2) <br>

               <img class="Q2ch3-5n" src="https://pathanto.com/Pathanto/image/7-1-4.png"
                    alt="NCERT Ex-7.1 class 10"><br>.
               Here AB = BC<br>
               here Two sides of isosceles triangle are equal .Given points are vertices of an isosceles triangle.<br>

               <h6 class="question">Question 5</h6> In a classroom, 4 friends are seated at the points A, B, C and D as
               shown in Fig. 7.8. Champa and Chameli walk into the class and after observing for a few minutes Champa
               asks Chameli, “Don’t you think ABCD is a square?” Chameli disagrees. Using distance formula, find which
               of them is correct.<br>

                    alt="NCERT Ex-7.1 class 10"><br>.

               <h6 class="answer">Answer</h6>

               As shown figure, the coordinates of points A, B, C and D are (3, 4), (6, 7), (9, 4) and (6,1).<br>

               Using Distance formula<br>

                    alt="NCERT Ex-7.1 class 10"><br>.

               AB = BC = CD = DA = 3√2<br>

               . ABCD is a square because all sides are of equal length so Champa was correct.<br>

               <h6 class="question">Question 6</h6> Name the type of quadrilateral formed, if any, by the following
               points, and give reasons for your answer:<br>

               (i) (- 1, – 2), (1, 0), (- 1, 2), (- 3, 0)<br>

               (ii) (- 3, 5), (3, 1), (0, 3), (- 1, – 4)<br>

               (iii) (4, 5), (7, 6), (4, 3), (1, 2)<br>

               <h6 class="answer">Answer</h6>

               (i) Let the points A(- 1, – 2), B(1, 0),C( – 1, 2), and D( – 3, 0) <br>

               <img class="Q2ch3-5n" src="https://pathanto.com/Pathanto/image/7-ex7.1-6.png"

                    alt="NCERT Ex-7.1 class 10"><br>

               Side length = AB = BC = CD = DA = 2√2<br>

               Diagonal = AC = BD = 4<br>

               Therefore, the given points are the vertices of a square.

               (ii) Let the points (- 3, 5), (3, 1), (0, 3), and ( – 1, – 4) be representing the vertices A, B, C, and D
               of the given quadrilateral respectively.

                    alt="NCERT Ex-7.1 class 10"><br>

               All sides of this quadrilateral are of different then it is a general quadrilateral.<br>

               (iii) Let the points A(4, 5), B(7, 6), C(4, 3), and D(1, 2) <br>

               NCERT Solutions for Class 10 Chapter 7-9<br>

               Opposite sides of this quadrilateral are of the same length. and the diagonals are of different lengths.
               So the given points are the vertices of a parallelogram.<br>

               <h6 class="question">Question 7</h6> Find the point on the x-axis which is equidistant from (2, – 5) and
               (- 2, 9).<br>

               <h6 class="answer">Answer</h6>

               Let the point on x-axis be (x,0).<br>

               A(x, 0); B(2, – 5) and C(- 2, 9)<br>

               <img class="Q2ch3-5n" src="https://pathanto.com/Pathanto/image/7-1-7.png"
                    alt="NCERT Ex-7.1 class 10"><br>




               Therefore, the point is (- 7, 0).

               <h6 class="question">Question 8</h6> Find the values of y for which the distance between the points P (2,
               – 3) and Q (10, y) is 10 units.<br>

               <h6 class="answer">Answer</h6>

               Distance between (2, – 3) and (10, y) is 10.<br>

               Squaring both sides,

               64 +(y+3)<sup>2</sup> = 100<br>

               (y+3)<sup>2</sup> = 36<br>

               y + 3 = ±6<br>

               y + 3 = +6 or y + 3 = −6<br>

               y = 3 or -9.<br>

               <h6 class="question">Question 9</h6> If Q (0, 1) is equidistant from P (5, – 3) and R (x, 6), find the

               <h6 class="answer">Answer</h6>

               Given: Q (0, 1) is equidistant from P (5, – 3) and R (x, 6)<br>
               PQ = QR
