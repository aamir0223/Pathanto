                    <li>A fluid called saliva secreted by the salivary glands</li>
                    <li>The food is mixed thoroughly with saliva and moved around the mouth while chewing by the
                         muscular tongue</li>
                    <li> Saliva has to be broken into smaller molecules with the help of biological catalysts called
                         enzymes</li>
                    <li>This enzyme called salivary amylase that breaks down complex molecule called starch to give

                    <li>The lining of canal has muscles that push the food forward</li>

                    <li>The muscular walls of the stomach help in mixing the food</li>
                    <li>gastric glands present in the wall of the stomach help for digestion </li>
                    <li>These release hydrochloric acid, a protein digesting enzyme called pepsin, and mucus. </li>
                    <li>The hydrochloric acid creates an acidic medium which facilitates the action of the enzyme pepsin
                    </li>
                    <li>The mucus protects the inner lining of the stomach from the action of the acid under normal

                    <li>The length of the small intestine differs in various animals depending on the food they eat.
                    </li>
                    <li><b style="color:#6f4a8e;"> Note </b> Herbivores eating grass need a longer small intestine to
                         allow the cellulose to be digested. Meat is easier
                         to digest, hence carnivores like tigers have a shorter small intestine.</li>

                    <li>The small intestine is the site of the complete digestion of carbohydrates, proteins and fats.
                    </li>
                    <li>Bile juice from the liver accomplishes this in addition to acting on fats.</li>
                    <li>Fats are present in the intestine in the form of large globules which makes it difficult for
                         enzymes to act on them So, Bile salts break them down into
                         smaller globules increasing the efficiency of enzyme action.</li>
                    <li>The pancreas secretes pancreatic juice which contains enzymes like trypsin for digesting
                         proteins and lipase for breaking down emulsified fats</li>
                    <li> Small intestine contain glands which secrete intestinal juice. </li>
                    <li>The enzymes present in it finally convert the proteins to amino acids, complex carbohydrates
                         into glucose and fats into fatty acids and glycerol.</li>
                    <li>The internal surface of the small intestine is folded into finger-like projections called villi.
                    </li>
                    <li>villi which increase the surface area for absorption.</li>
                    <li>The unabsorbed food is sent into the large intestine where more villi absorb water from this
                         material</li>
                    <li>The rest of the material is removed from the body via the anus. </li>

               <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;"> RESPIRATION: </b><br>i)Respiration means the exchange of gases.<br>
                    ii)Breaking down of glucose into pyruvate: This happens in the cytoplasm. Glucose molecule is broken
                    down into pyruvic acid. Glucose molecule is composed of 6 carbon atoms, while pyruvic acid is
                    composed of 3 carbon atoms.<br>
                    iii)Fate of Pyruvic Acid: Further breaking down of pyruvic acid takes place in mitochondria and the
                    molecules formed depend on the type of respiration in a particular organism. Respiration is of two
                    types, viz. aerobic respiration and anaerobic respiration.
                    Respiration involves<br>
                    Gaseous exchange: Intake of oxygen from the atmosphere and release of CO<sub>2</sub> →
                    Breathing.<br>
                    Breakdown of simple food in order to release energy inside the cell → Cellular respiration<br>
                    4)During the process of respiration, complex organic compounds such as glucose
                    are broken down to provide energy in the form of ATP. ATP is used to provide
                    energy for other reactions in the cell.

               <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;"> Aerobic respiration: </b> Breakdown of pyruvate using oxygen takes place in
                    the mitochondria. This process breaks up the three-carbon pyruvate molecule to give three molecules
                    of carbon dioxide and water is called aerobic
                    respiration</p>
               <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;"> Anaerobic respiration:: </b> The pyruvate may be converted into ethanol and
                    carbon dioxide. This process takes place in yeast during fermentation. Since this process takes
                    place in the absence of air (oxygen), it is called anaerobic respiration</p>

                    <li> Fishes take in water through their mouths and force it past the gills where the dissolved
