  <p> <b style="color:#6f4a8e;">chemical changes:</b>when a substance combines with another to form  one or more new substance with different  physical and chemical properties called chemical  changes</p>
   <p>for exmple</p>
   <p>magnesium ribbon burns with adazzling white flame and changes into a white powder. This powder is  magnesium oxide.<br> Mg + O<sub>2</sub> <span class="arrow">&rarr;</span> MgO</p>
   
    <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;">Physical change</b> – Physical changes can include changing the color, shape, state of matter, or volume of a substance but no new substance is formed.<br>
Example: Boiling water evaporating.<br>
Hot shower water turning to steam.</p>
    <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;">Chemical reaction:</b><br>  Chemical reaction are the process in which new substance formed with new properties <br><br><b style="color:#6f4a8e;">observations helps us to determine whether a chemical reaction has taken place</b> –<br>
 change in state<br>
 change in colour<br>
 evolution of a gas<br>
change in temperature.</p>
    <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;">CHEMICAL EQUATIONS </b><br>A method  of  expressing chemical reaction in words or sentence  rather than chemical formulas. it helps identify the reactants and products in a chemical reaction. for example <br>The word-equation for the above reaction would be <br>
Magnesium + Oxygen <span class="arrow">&rarr;</span> Magnesium oxide</p> 
    <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;">Writing chemical equations </b><br> A method of representation of a chemical reaction in with the help of  symbols and chemical formulae of the reactants and products is known as a chemical equation.</p>
    <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;">Balancing of a Chemical Reaction</b></p>
    <p> <b style="color:#6f4a8e;">Balanced chemical equation</b> <br> The chemical equation in which the number of atoms of each element in the reactants  is equal to that of the products  is called a balanced chemical equation. or we can say a balance chemical reaction have equal number of atom of differen element on reactants and product side </p>
    <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;">why we balance the chemical equation</b></p>
    <p>Ans::As we know chemical reactions follow the law of conservation of mass. In law of conservation of mass ,"matter can neither be created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction" it mean total mass of all the reactants must be equal to the total mass of the product .So  we have to make the number of different type of atom equal on both side of a chemical equation is konwn as balance the chemical equation. So the chemical equation are balance to  satisfy the law of conservation of mass.  </p>
    <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;">Balancing of  chemical equation</b> <br> The equation are balance by hit and trial method. Let take an example to understand the balancing chemical equation <br>Zinc + Sulphuric acid ® Zinc sulphate + Hydrogen</p>
    <p>Zn + H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> <span class="arrow">&rarr;</span> ZnSO<sub>4</sub> + H<sub>2</sub></p>
    <p> here number of atoms of different elements on bothsides of the reactants and products .</p>
    <p>
           <table>
            <tr>
           <th> Element</th> <th>Number of atoms in reactants (LHS)   </th> <th>Number of atoms in products (RHS)</th>
           </tr>
           <tr>            
           <td>Zn</td>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>1</td>


           </tr>
           <tr>            
           <td>H</td>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>2</td>


           </tr>
           <tr>            
           <td>S</td>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>1</td>


           </tr>
           <tr>            
           <td>O</td>
            <td>4</td>
            <td>4</td>
           </tr>
           </table>
           As the number of atoms of each element is the same on both sides reactants and products then it is a balanced chemical equation.
     
</p>
  <?php include "../../body-add-container.php"; ?>
    <p>   Let us try to balance the following chemical equation –
Fe + H<sub>2</sub>O <span class="arrow">&rarr;</span> Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> + H<sub>2</sub><br>
<strong>Step I:</strong> let count the  number of atoms of different elements present in the
unbalanced equation<br>
<table>
            <tr>
           <th> Element</th> <th>Number of atoms in reactants (LHS)   </th> <th>Number of atoms in products (RHS)</th>
           </tr>
           <tr>            
           <td>Fe</td>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>3</td>


           </tr>
           <tr>            
           <td>H</td>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>2</td>


           </tr>
           <tr>            
           <td>O</td>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>4</td>


           </tr>
           
           </table>
 <strong>Step II:</strong>        select the element which has the maximum
number of atoms. Using these criteria, we select Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and the element
oxygen in it. There are four oxygen atoms on the RHS and only one onthe LHS.<br>
<table>
            <tr>
           <th>Atom of Oxygen  </th> <th>atoms in reactants    </th> <th>atoms in products </th>
           </tr>
           <tr>            
           <td>intinal</td>
            <td> 1 in (H<sub>2</sub>O</td>
            <td>4 in (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>)</td>


           </tr>
           <tr>            
           <td> To Balance</td>
            <td>1 x 4</td>
            <td>4</td>


           </tr>
           
           
           </table>
           Now the partly balanced equation
becomes –<br>
             Fe + 4H<sub>2</sub>O <span class="arrow">&rarr;</span> Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>
           <strong>Step III:</strong>
           Fe and H atoms are still not balanced. Pick any of these elements to proceed further. Let us balance hydrogen atoms in the partly balanced equation.<br>
           <table>
            <tr>
           <th>Atom of Hydrogen </th> <th>atoms in reactants    </th> <th>atoms in products </th>
           </tr>
           <tr>            
           <td>intinal</td>
            <td> 8 in (H<sub>2</sub>O</td>
            <td>2 in (H<sub>2</sub>)</td>


           </tr>
           <tr>            
           <td> To Balance</td>
            <td>8</td>
            <td>2 x4</td>


           </tr>
           
           
           </table>
            Now the partly balanced equation
becomes –<br>
             Fe + 4H<sub>2</sub>O <span class="arrow">&rarr;</span> Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> + 4H<sub>2</sub><br>
            <strong>Step IV:</strong> only one element is left to be
balanced, that is, iron.<br>
 <table>
            <tr>
           <th>Atom of Iron </th> <th>atoms in reactants    </th> <th>atoms in products </th>
           </tr>
           <tr>            
           <td>intinal</td>
            <td> 1  ( in Fe)</td>
            <td>3 (in Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>)</td>


           </tr>
           <tr>            
           <td> To Balance</td>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>1 x3</td>


           </tr>
           
           
           </table>
            Now the partly balanced equation
becomes –<br>
             3Fe + 4H<sub>2</sub>O <span class="arrow">&rarr;</span> Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> + 4H<sub>2</sub><br>
         <strong>Step V:</strong>   Finally, to check the correctness of the balanced equation, we
count atoms of each element on both sides of the equation.<br>

3Fe + 4H<sub>2</sub>O <span class="arrow">&rarr;</span> Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> + 4H<sub>2</sub><br>
