      <h4 class="question">Question 1</h4>
      <h1 class="important-question">
       What type of bond is formed between carbon atoms in a carbon compound?
      </h1>
       <h4 class="answer">Answer </h4>
      <p class="important-answer">Covalent bond.</p>

      <h4 class="question">Question 2</h4>
      <h1 class="important-question">Why can't carbon form ionic bonds</h1>
      <h4 class="answer">Answer </h4>
      <p class="important-answer">Carbon can't form ionic bonds because it's difficult for it to gain or lose 4 electrons.</p>

      <h4 class="question">Question 3</h4>
      <h1 class="important-question">What is catenation?</h1>
        <h4 class="answer">Answer </h4>
      <p class="important-answer">Catenation is the ability of an element to form chains or rings by bonding with atoms of the same element.</p>

      <?php include "../../body-add-container.php"; ?>

      <h4 class="question">Question 4</h4>
      <h1 class="important-question">Why is carbon so versatile?</h1>
      <h4 class="answer">Answer </h4>
      <p class="important-answer">1. Catenation: Carbon has a unique ability to form long chains and rings of carbon atoms, a property known as catenation. This ability to form stable bonds with other carbon atoms is due to its small size and tetravalent nature. This leads to the formation of a large number of compounds with varying properties.</br>

2. Tetravalency: Carbon has four electrons in its outermost shell, allowing it to form four strong covalent bonds with other atoms, including other carbon atoms and atoms of other elements like hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur. This allows it to form a wide variety of structures and compounds.</br>

3. Ability to Form Multiple Types of Bonds: Carbon can form single, double, and triple bonds with other carbon atoms, leading to a wide variety of compounds with different properties.</br>

4. Stability of Carbon-Carbon Bonds: Carbon-carbon bonds are very stable, which allows for the creation of large, complex molecules that are stable under a wide range of conditions.</br>

5. Ability to Form Compounds with Different Functional Groups: Carbon can form compounds with different functional groups (like -OH, -COOH, -NH2, etc.), which drastically change the properties of the compounds. This results in an even greater variety of carbon compounds..</p>
