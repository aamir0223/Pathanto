        <h4 class="question">Question 17</h4>
      <h1 class="important-question">Describe the structure and function of a nerve cell.</h1>
      <h4 class="answer">Answer </h4>
      <p class="important-answer">A nerve cell, also known as a neuron, is the primary conductor of electricity in the nervous system.</br>

Structure: A neuron has three main parts:</br>

Cell body: This is the central portion of the tissue, which contains the nucleus and other cell organelles. It is responsible for normal muscle function and maintenance.</br>
Dendrites: These are small branches that extend from the cell body. Sensations are received and transmitted to the cell body.</br>
Axon: This is a long rod-shaped extension that carries impulses from the cell body to other tissues or motor components such as muscles or nerves. The axon is coated with a myelin sheath that acts as a protective layer and increases the velocity of impulse transmission.</br>
Function: The primary function of nerve cells or nerves is to transmit information in the form of electrical signals or sensations from one part of the body to another, helping to coordinate and control body functions and functions. For example, sensory neurons carry information from sensory neurons (such as touching our skin or heat on our skin) to those of the brain and spinal cord The sensory nervous system signals travel from the brain and spinal cord to nerves or nerves, allowing us to respond to changes in our skin .</p>

        <h4 class="question">Question 18</h4>
      <h1 class="important-question">Describe the role of the cerebrum, cerebellum, and medulla in the brain.</h1>
      <h4 class="answer">Answer </h4>
      <p class="important-answer">cerebrum, cerebellum, and Medulla There are three main parts of the brain, each with a specific function.</br>

cerebrum: It is the largest part of the brain and is divided into two parts. It regulates higher brain function, including, and generally, complex behaviors such as interpreting sensory information, learning and understanding, voluntary movements, reasoning, reading, writing, and emotions , the right hemisphere is responsible for creativity, spatial abilities, artistic and musical skills. The left hemisphere controls logic, language, reasoning, and mathematical abilities.
</br>
Cerebellum: The cerebellum, located at the base of the brainstem at the back of the brain, regulates voluntary motor activity. It controls our balance, coordination and posture, ensuring that all our movements are smooth and precise. The brain also plays a role in motor skills, such as learning to ride a bike or learning another dance.
</br>
Medulla: The medulla, also known as the medulla oblongata, is located in the lower part of the brain, just above the spinal cord. It controls many vital automated processes, including heart rate, blood pressure, and respiration. It also controls certain reactions such as coughing, sneezing and swallowing.</p>
      
      
        <h4 class="question">Question 19</h4>
      <h1 class="important-question">Explain the structure and functions of the human ear.</h1>
      <h4 class="answer">Answer </h4>
      <p class="important-answer">The human ear is a complex organ that performs two main functions: hearing and maintaining balance or equilibrium. The external ear, the middle ear and the inner ear are divided into three parts.</br>

External ear: The pinna (the part of the ear you can see) and the external ear are located. The pinna collects sound waves and directs them to the ear canal. These sound waves then descend through the auditory meatus to the eardrum.</br>

Middle ear: The middle ear begins in the eardrum (also known as the tympanic membrane), which is a thin cone that vibrates as sound waves enter it. The middle ear also contains three small bones called osteoblasts: malleus (rope), . the incus (the anvil), and the stapes (the bump). f. These bones amplify sound waves and transmit them to the inner ear.</br>

Inner ear: The inner ear contains the cochlea and vestibular system. The cochlea is a spiral organ that converts vibrations from bones into electrical signals. These signals are then sent to the brain via the auditory nerve. A vestibular system of three semicircular canals and the vestibule control balance.
</br>
Functions of the ear:</br>

Ear: The ear converts sound waves into electrical signals that can be interpreted by the brain. This affects the outer, middle and inner ears.
Balance: The ears also play an important role in balancing. Semi-circular tubes, water and fine hair-like follicles with inner ears and a vestibule to help position and balance the head

        <h4 class="question">Question 20</h4>
      <h1 class="important-question">What is the role of the pituitary gland in the human body?</h1>
      <h4 class="answer">Answer </h4>
      <p class="important-answer">Often referred to as the "master gland," the pituitary gland plays an important role in the human body as it regulates many other endocrine glands. It is a small, pea-sized tube at the base of the brain. The pituitary gland is divided into anterior and posterior pituitary glands, each secreting specific hormones that fulfill different functions</br>

Anterior Pituitary: Produces and secretes many hormones, e.g.</br>

i)Growth Hormone (GH): Stimulates growth and cell reproduction in the body.</br>
ii)Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH): Stimulates the thyroid gland to produce thyroid hormone.</br>
iii)Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH): Stimulates the adrenal glands to produce cortisol.</br>
iv)Prolactin: Stimulates milk production in women.</br>
v)Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH): These hormones regulate sexual function and fertility in both sexes.</br>
Posterior pituitary: Stores and releases hormones produced in the hypothalamus, e.g.</br>

Antidiuretic hormone (ADH): Regulates fluid balance in the body.</br>
Oxytocin: Stimulates uterine contractions and milk production during labor in lactating women.
In summary, the pituitary gland plays an important role in growth, metabolism, energy levels, stress response, reproduction, and many other vital bodily functions</p>
