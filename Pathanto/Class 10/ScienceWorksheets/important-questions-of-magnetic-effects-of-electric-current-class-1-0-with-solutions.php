        <h4 class="question">Question 12</h4>
      <h1 class="important-question">What is electromagnetic induction?</h1>
      <h4 class="answer">Answer </h4>
      <p class="important-answer">Electromagnetic induction is the process of generating an electromotive force (EMF) in a coil by changing the magnetic field around it, either by moving the coil or changing the current in a nearby coil.</p>
      
        <h4 class="question">Question 13</h4>
      <h1 class="important-question">State Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction.</h1>

      <h1 class="important-question">How does a transformer work?</h1>
      <h4 class="answer">Answer </h4>
      <p class="important-answer">A transformer works on the principle of electromagnetic induction. It consists of two coils (primary and secondary) placed close to each other. When the current in the primary coil changes, it induces an EMF in the secondary coil, leading to the transfer of electrical energy.</p>
      
      
        <h4 class="question">Question 15</h4>
      <h1 class="important-question">Define magnetic flux.</h1>
      <h4 class="answer">Answer </h4>
      <p class="important-answer"> Magnetic flux is the measure of the total magnetic field passing through a given area, and it is calculated as the product of the magnetic field strength, area, and the angle between them.

      <h1 class="important-question">What is the magnetic field due to a current through a straight conductor?</h1>
      <h4 class="answer">Answer </h4>
      <p class="important-answer">The magnetic field around a straight conductor carrying current exhibits circular patterns. As the current increases, the strength of the magnetic field intensifies. Understanding this relationship is crucial in various applications, from designing electrical systems to explaining the behavior of everyday objects influenced by magnetic fields.

  <h4 class="question">Question 23</h4>
      <h1 class="important-question">Explain the magnetic field due to a current in a solenoid.</h1>
      <h4 class="answer">Answer </h4>
      <p class="important-answer">Solenoids play a crucial role in generating strong and uniform magnetic fields. When an electric current flows through a solenoid—a coil of wire wound in a helical manner—it produces a magnetic field with parallel field lines along the axis of the solenoid. This property is extensively utilized in various devices, including electromagnets and transformers.
.</p>

 <h4 class="question">Question 24</h4>
      <h1 class="important-question">How does the strength of an electromagnet change with an increase in current?</h1>
      <h4 class="answer">Answer </h4>
      <p class="important-answer">The strength of an electromagnet is directly proportional to the current flowing through the coil. Increasing the current boosts the magnetic field strength, making electromagnets versatile tools in controlling magnetic forces in various applications, including robotics, speakers, and magnetic locks.
