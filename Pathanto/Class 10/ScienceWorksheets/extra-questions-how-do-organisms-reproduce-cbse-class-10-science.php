      <h4 class="question">Question 1</h4>
      <h1 class="important-question">
     What is reproduction? Explain the types of reproduction.
      </h1>
       <h4 class="answer">Answer </h4>
      <p class="important-answer">Reproduction is a biological process in which new individuals of the same species are produced by one parent (asexual reproduction) or both parents (sexual reproduction).</br>
      <b> Asexual reproduction: </b>This is where single parents produce offspring without the involvement of gametes (sex cells). Children born are like their parents. Examples include binary fission in bacteria and budding in yeast.</br>

<b>Sexual reproduction:</b> This applies to parents of the opposite sex. They produce gametes that combine to form a new person. Offspring are genetically different from their parents. Examples are humans, animals, and plants.

      <h1 class="important-question">Define the term 'Regeneration'.</h1>
      <h4 class="answer">Answer </h4>
      <p class="important-answer">Regeneration is an asexual reproduction in which an organism can reproduce or regrow its lost body parts. This method is common in starfish, hydra and other creatures</p>

      <h4 class="question">Question 3</h4>
      <h1 class="important-question">What is binary fission? Provide an example.</h1>
        <h4 class="answer">Answer </h4>
      <p class="important-answer">Binary fission is a method of asexual reproduction in which a parent organism divides into two equal parts, each becoming a new organism. Amoeba and bacteria reproduce by this method.</p>

      <h4 class="question">Question 7</h4>
      <h1 class="important-question">What is the importance of DNA copying in reproduction?</h1>
      <h4 class="answer">Answer </h4>
      <p class="important-answer">DNA copying is important in reproduction as it helps in the transmission of characters or traits from parents to offspring. It ensures the continuity of life by producing variations which are essential for the process of evolution.</p>

      <h4 class="question">Question 8</h4>
      <h1 class="important-question">What is sexual reproduction? Explain the process in flowering plants.</h1>
      <h4 class="answer">Answer </h4>
      <p class="important-answer">Sexual reproduction is the process involving the fusion of male and female gametes. In flowering plants, the male gamete is found in the pollen grain (produced in anther), and the female gamete is found in the ovule (contained in the ovary). The transfer of pollen from anther to the stigma is called pollination. The fusion of male and female gametes is called fertilization, resulting in the formation of seeds.</p>

      <h4 class="question">Question 9</h4>
      <h1 class="important-question">What is pollination? </h1>
      <h4 class="answer">Answer </h4>
      <p class="important-answer">Pollination is the transfer of pollen grains from the anther of one flower to the stigma of the same or another flower. It can be self-pollination (within the same flower) or cross-pollination (between two different flowers).</p>

      <h4 class="question">Question 10</h4>
      <h1 class="important-question">What is the role of the testes in the human male reproductive system?</h1>
      <h4 class="answer">Answer </h4>
      <p class="important-answer">The testes in the human male reproductive system are responsible for the production of male gametes or sperm cells. They also produce the hormone testosterone, which is responsible for the development of secondary sexual characteristics in males.</p>
      
        <h4 class="question">Question 11</h4>
      <h1 class="important-question">Explain the menstrual cycle.</h1>
      <h4 class="answer">Answer </h4>
      <p class="important-answer">The menstrual cycle is a monthly cycle in females which prepares the uterus for pregnancy. It involves the maturation of the egg, its release (ovulation), preparation of the uterus for implantation. If fertilization does not occur, the lining of the uterus sheds off, causing menstruation.</p>

        <h4 class="question">Question 12</h4>
      <h1 class="important-question">What is fertilization?</h1>
      <h4 class="answer">Answer </h4>
      <p class="important-answer">Fertilization is the process of fusion of the male and female gametes resulting in the formation of a zygote. This zygote develops into a new individual.</p>
      
        <h4 class="question">Question 13</h4>
      <h1 class="important-question">What is the role of the placenta in human reproduction?</h1>
      <h4 class="answer">Answer </h4>
      <p class="important-answer">The placenta is a temporary organ that connects the developing fetus via the umbilical cord to the uterine wall to allow nutrient uptake, waste elimination, and gas exchange via the mother's blood supply. It produces hormones that are necessary for pregnancy, such as progesterone and estrogen, which maintain the lining of the uterus and stimulate the development of mammary glands, respectively. The placenta also serves as a barrier to most harmful substances, protecting the fetus, although it's not entirely impermeable and some substances such as alcohol, drugs, and certain diseases can cross this barrier and harm the fetus.</p>
      
        <h4 class="question">Question 14</h4>
      <h1 class="important-question">What are sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)?</h1>
      <h4 class="answer">Answer </h4>
      <p class="important-answer">STDs are infectious diseases that spread from person to person through sexual contact. They are caused by bacteria, viruses, or parasites that can lead to severe health problems if left untreated. Examples include HIV/AIDS, syphilis, gonorrhea, and herpes. It's important to practice safe sex and get regular check-ups to prevent these diseases</p>
      
      
        <h4 class="question">Question 15</h4>
      <h1 class="important-question">What is the importance of reproduction in organisms?</h1>
      <h4 class="answer">Answer </h4>
      <p class="important-answer">Reproduction is vital for organisms as it ensures the continuation of a species or a generation. It results in offspring that are genetically similar to the parents. Reproduction also leads to variations in species which are necessary for evolution and adaptation to changing environments.

        <h4 class="question">Question 16</h4>
      <h1 class="important-question">What are the different methods of contraception? </h1>
      <h4 class="answer">Answer </h4>
      <p class="important-answer">Contraception methods are used to prevent pregnancy. They include barrier methods (like condoms and diaphragms), hormonal methods (like birth control pills and patches), intrauterine devices (IUDs), emergency contraceptives, and permanent methods like sterilization. Each method works differently and the choice depends on an individual's health, frequency of sexual activity, number of sexual partners, and desire to have children in the future.

        <h4 class="question">Question 17</h4>
      <h1 class="important-question">Explain the process of fertilization in humans.</h1>
      <h4 class="answer">Answer </h4>
      <p class="important-answer">In humans, fertilization begins when a sperm penetrates an egg. This happens in the fallopian tubes, after ovulation. Once a sperm has penetrated the egg, the chromosomes from both parents combine, resulting in a zygote. This zygote then begins to divide, forming an embryo which moves down to the uterus and implants itself in the uterine wall, marking the beginning of pregnancy</p>

        <h4 class="question">Question 18</h4>
      <h1 class="important-question">Why is variation beneficial for species?</h1>
      <h4 class="answer">Answer </h4>
      <p class="important-answer"> Variation is beneficial for species as it contributes to the survival and evolution of a species. It allows organisms to adapt to changes in their environment and provides a basis for natural selection, where individuals with advantageous traits are more likely to survive and reproduce. This leads to the evolution of species over time.</p>
      
      
        <h4 class="question">Question 19</h4>
      <h1 class="important-question">What is the role of the ovary in the female reproductive system?</h1>
      <h4 class="answer">Answer </h4>
      <p class="important-answer">The ovary is an organ of the female reproductive system that produces eggs (ovum). Each month, during the menstrual cycle, an egg is released from the ovary in a process called ovulation. The ovaries are also responsible for producing the female sex hormones, estrogen, and progesterone, which regulate the menstrual cycle and pregnancy</p>

        <h4 class="question">Question 20</h4>
      <h1 class="important-question">What is the difference between asexual and sexual reproduction? </h1>
      <h4 class="answer">Answer </h4>
      <p class="important-answer">Asexual reproduction involves only one parent and the offspring are genetically identical to the parent. It does not involve the fusion of gametes. Examples include binary fission in bacteria, budding in hydra. In contrast, sexual reproduction involves two parents and the offspring are genetically different from the parents. It involves the fusion of male and female gametes. Examples include humans, animals, and most plants.</p>
