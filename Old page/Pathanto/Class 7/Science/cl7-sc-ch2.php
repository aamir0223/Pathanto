 <h6 class="question"> Question 5.</h6>
  What are villi? What is their location and function?

<h6 class="answer">Answer 5</h6>
The finger-like outgrowths  on the inner surface of the small intestine which help in absorbing the digested food are called vill

The villi increase the surface area for absorption of the digested food. Each villus has a network of thin and small blood vessels close to its surface. The surface of the villi absorbs the digested food materials.<br><br>

 <h6 class="question"> Question 6.</h6>
  Where is the bile produced? Which component of the food does it help to digest?

<h6 class="answer">Answer 6</h6>

liver  produced   bile juice that is stored in a sac  called the gall bladder . It plays an important role in the digestion of fats.<br><br>

 <h6 class="question"> Question 7.</h6>
  Name the type of carbohydrate that can be digested by ruminants but not by humans. Give the reason also.
<h6 class="answer">Answer 7</h6>

The name of the carbohydrate is cellulose. It is digested by ruminants but not by humans because  ruminants have a large sac-like structure called rumen which is located between the small intestine and large intestine. Certain enzymes present   which  digest cellulose and that is   not present in humans.<br><br>

 <h6 class="question"> Question 8.</h6>
  Why do we get instant energy from glucose?

<h6 class="answer">Answer 8</h6>

Glucose is the simplest form of carbohydrates and in the cell glucose break down with the help of oxygen into carbon dioxide  and water and lots of energy is released and we get instant energy<br><br>

 <h6 class="question"> Question 10.</h6>
  Write one similarity and one difference between the nutrition in amoeba and human beings.

<h6 class="answer">Answer 10</h6>
Similarity: Both Amoeba and human beings are heterotrophs and derive nutrition from other organisms andboth need digestive juices for the digestion of food.<br>
Dissimilarity: Human beings have a complex digestive system and different nutrients are digested in separate regions. Amoeba does not have a digestive system and all the nutrients are digested in the food vacuole and  also Humans need to chew the food on the other hand amoeba does not need to chew the food.<br><br>

<img class="Q2ch3-5n digestive" src="/Pathanto/image/digestive-system-answer.png">



 <h6 class="question"> Question 13.</h6>
  Can we survive only on raw, leafy vegetables/grass? Discuss.

<h6 class="answer">Answer 13</h6>

No, It is because the grass is rich in cellulose, which is a type of carbohydrate that humans are not able to digest due to the absence of cellulose-digesting enzymes  We need all required nutrients, such as carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, vitamins and minerals, from them .So,We cannot survive only on raw, leafy vegetables/grass, because we need  balance diet to live long and healthy life.<br><br>
