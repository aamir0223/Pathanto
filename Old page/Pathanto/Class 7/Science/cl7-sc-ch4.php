<p><h5  class="question" >Question 5</h5> Discuss why wearing more layers of clothing during winter keeps us warmer than wearing just one thick piece of clothing.</p>
<h5  class="answer" >Answer </h5>

<p>More layers of clothing during winter keeps us warmer  because as they have a lot of space between them and  air gets trapped between layer. As air is a bad conductor of heat it does not allow the escape of the heat  out of the  body.</p>

<p><h5  class="question" >Question 6</h5> Look at Fig. 4.13. Mark where the heat is being transferred by conduction, by convection and by radiation.</p>
<p><img class="Q2ch3-5n" src="/Pathanto/image/ch4-7-1.jpg" ><br></p>

<h5  class="answer" >Answer </h5>

<p><h5  class="question" >Question 7</h5> In places of hot climate it is advised that the outer walls of houses be painted white. Explain.</p>
<h5  class="answer" >Answer </h5>
<p>In places of hot climate, it is advised that the outer walls of houses be painted white because white colour is best reflected colour and  poor absorber of heat. So  the houses do not heat up too much</p>

<p><h5  class="question" >Question 8</h5> One litre of water at 30°C is mixed with one litre of water at 50°C. The temperature of the mixture will be </p>
<p>(a) 80°C (b) more than 50°C but less than 80°C <br>(c) 20°C (d) between 30°C and 50°C</p>
<h5  class="answer" >Answer </h5>
<p> between 30°C and 50°C .</p>
<p><h5  class="question" >Question 9</h5> An iron ball at 40°C is dropped in a mug containing water at 40°C. The heat will </p>
<p>(a) flow from iron ball to water. </p>
<p>(b) not flow from iron ball to water or from water to iron ball. </p>
<p>(c) flow from water to iron ball.</p>
<p>(d) increase the temperature of both.</p>
<h5  class="answer" >Answer </h5>
<p> (b) not flow from iron ball to water or from water to iron ball </p>
<p><h5  class="question" >Question 10</h5> A wooden spoon is dipped in a cup of ice cream. Its other end </p>
<p>(a) becomes cold by the process of conduction. </p>
<p>(b) becomes cold by the process of convection. </p>
<p>(c) becomes cold by the process of radiation. </p>
<p>(d) does not become cold.</p>
<h5  class="answer" >Answer </h5>

<p> (d) does not become cold because wood is a bad conductor of heat.</p>

<p><h5  class="question" >Question 11</h5> Stainless steel pans are usually provided with copper bottoms. The reason for this could be that </p>
<p>(a) copper bottom makes the pan more durable. </p>
<p>(b) such pans appear colourful. </p>
<p>(c) copper is a better conductor of heat than stainless steel. </p>
<p>(d) copper is easier to clean than stainless steel.</p>
<h5  class="answer" >Answer </h5>

<p> (c) copper is a better conductor of heat than the stainless steel.</p>
