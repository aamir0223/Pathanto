          <h5 class="sc-chapter-name"> 4:Carbon and Its Compounds</h5>
          i) Food, clothes, medicines, books, or many of the things that you listed
are all based on this versatile element carbon.<br>
ii). The earth’s crust has only 0.02% carbon in the form of minerals (like carbonates, hydrogencarbonates, coal and petroleum) and the atmosphere has 0.03% of carbon  dioxide
      <p> <b style="color:#6f4a8e;">Ionic Bonds:</b>Ionic bonding is a type of chemical bonding that involves the electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions, or between two atoms with sharply different electronegativities <br>
      i)  ionic compounds have high melting and boiling
points<br>
ii)  conduct electricity in solution or in the molten state<br>
</p>
      <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;">which difficulty of Carbon to Form a Stable:</b> <br>i) It could gain four electrons forming C4– anion. But it would be difficult
for the nucleus with six protons to hold on to ten electrons, that is,
four extra electrons.<br>
(ii) It could lose four electrons forming C4+ cation. But it would require
a large amount of energy to remove four electrons leaving behind a
carbon cation with six protons in its nucleus holding on to just two
electrons.</p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;"> Covalent Bond:</b>Such bonds which are formed by the sharing of an electron pair
between two atoms are known as covalent bonds.<br>
i) Have low melting and boiling point<br>ii) poor conductors of electricity<br><br>
      <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;">Types of Covalent Bond:</b><br><br>

<b style="color:#6f4a8e;">Single Covalent Bond:</b> When a single pair of electrons are shared between two atoms in a molecule. For example; Cl<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub> etc.<br><br> <img class="Q2ch3-5n" src="/Pathanto/image/hydrogen.png"><br><br>
<b style="color:#6f4a8e;">Double Covalent Bond:</b> When two pairs of electrons are shared between two atoms in a molecule. For example; O<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub> etc.<br><br> <img class="Q2ch3-5n" src="/Pathanto/image/oxygen.jpg"><br><br>
<b style="color:#6f4a8e;"> Triple Covalent Bond:</b> When three pairs of electrons are shared between two atoms in a molecule. For example; N<sub>2</sub> etc.<br> <img class="Q2ch3-5n" src="/Pathanto/image/nitrogen.jpg"><br><br></p>
      <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;"> Allotropes of carbon </b>The element carbon occurs in different forms in nature with

other carbon atoms forming a rigid three-dimensional
structure <br> Diamond is
the hardest substance</p>
      <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;"> graphite </b><br><img class="Q2ch3-5n" src="/Pathanto/image/graphite.png"><br><br> <ul><li>Each carbon atom is bonded to three
other carbon atoms in the same plane giving a hexagonal array</li><li>One of these bonds is a double-bond, and thus the valency of
carbon is satisfied.</li><li> Graphite structure is formed by the
hexagonal arrays being placed in layers one above the other</li><li>graphite is smooth and slippery</li><li> Graphite is also
a very good conductor of electricity unlike other non-metals</li> </ul></p>

      <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;"> Nomenclature of Carbon Compounds</b><br>Naming a carbon compound can be done by the following method –<br>i)Identify the number of carbon atoms in the compound. <br>(ii) In case a functional group is present, it is indicated in the
name of the compound with either a prefix or a suffix (as given
below).<br>
(iii) If the name of the functional group is to be given as a suffix, the
name of the carbon chain is modified by deleting the final ‘e’ and
adding the appropriate suffix. For example, a three-carbon chain
with a ketone group would be named in the following manner –
Propane – ‘e’ = propan + ‘one’ = propanone.<br>
(iv) If the carbon chain is unsaturated, then the final ‘ane’ in the name
of the carbon chain is substituted by ‘ene’ or ‘yne’ as given below For example, a three-carbon chain with a double bond
would be called propene and if it has a triple bond, it would be
called propyne. <br><img class="Q2ch3-5n" src="/Pathanto/image/table4-4.png"><br><br></p>

hydrocarbons.<br><br>one end of the molecules is towards the oil droplet
while the ionic-end faces outside.<br>. The
soap micelle thus helps in dissolving the dirt in water and we can wash
