      <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;">CIRCUIT DIAGRAM:</b><br>
It is often convenient to draw a schematic diagram, in which different
components of the circuit are represented by the symbols conveniently
used.  <br><img class="Q2ch3-5n" src="/Pathanto/image/symble.png" width="500" alt="chapter 11 Electricity notes "><br><br></p>
      <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;">OHM’S LAW:</b><br> It's stated that the electric current flowing
through a metallic wire is directly proportional to the
potential difference V, across its ends provided its
temperature remains the same. This is called Ohm’s law<br>
<b> <center>V ∝ I <br>
or V/I = constant<br>
= R<br>
or V = IR</center></b>
 Where  R is a constant for the given metallic wire
at a given temperature and is called its resistance.<br>



</p>
      <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;">Resistance:</b> It is the
property of a conductor to resist the flow of charges through it
</p>
      <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;">SI Unit of Resistance:</b>  Its SI unit is ohm(Ω)<br>,
<b>R = V/I</b></p>
      <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;">Define 1 ohm:</b> If the potential difference across the two ends of a conductor is 1 V
and the current through it is 1 A, then the resistance R, of the conductor
is 1 Ω </p>

<b> Note </b>the current through a resistor is
inversely proportional to its resistance. If the resistance is doubled the
current gets halved. 
      <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;">variable
resistance: </b>A component used to
regulate current without changing the voltage source is called variable
resistance</p>
      <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;">  Factor effecting the resistance of a conductor: </b><br> The resistance of the conductor depends on following:<br> (i) on its length  <br>(ii) on its area of cross-section,<br>(iii) on the nature of its material <br>
     a) Resistance of a given  conductor is directly proportional to its lenght <br>
         <center> <b>R ∝ l</b></center>

      V<sub>1</sub>,V<sub>2</sub>,V<sub>3</sub> respectily connecting in series with battery of V volts has been applied to the end of this series combination
      <br>
      Now<br>
        That is the total potential difference
across a combination of resistors in series is equal to the sum of potential
difference across the individual resistors<br>   V = V<sub>1</sub> + V<sub>2</sub> +  V<sub>3</sub> ..............(1)<br>

      <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;">1)  Disadvantage of a series : </b><br>
        i) when one
electrical appliance fails the circuit is broken and none of the electrical appliance  works<br>
  ii)  In series circuit all electric appliance connected only one switch So we can not turn of separately.<br>
  iii) Do not get eqaul volt of each electric appliance<br>


      </p>
      <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;">  Advantages of a  parallel : </b><br>
      i)  a parallel
circuit divides the current through the electrical gadgets<br>
ii)Each electric appliance get eqaul volt <br></p>

      <p>. The work done in moving the charge Q
through a potential difference V is VQ. Therefore, the source must supply
energy equal to VQ in time t.</p>

      <p>  From equation 2 and 3 in 1 ,we get </p>
                    W  =  I x t x I x R<br>
               So, Work done W  = I<sup>2</sup> x R x t<br>
               for a steady
current I, the amount of heat H produced in time t is <br>
     <b>H =I<sup>2</sup> x R x t   </b>This is known as Joule’s law of heating.<br><br>
    The
law implies that heat produced in a resistor is<br>
i)) directly proportional to the square of current
for a given resistance<br>
 (ii) directly proportional to
resistance for a given current  <br> (iii) directly
proportional to the time for which the current flows

i)The electric laundry iron, electric toaster, electric oven, electric kettle and
