                  <p>  All the element can be divided into two group on the basis of their property <br>i)Metal<br>ii)Non Metal </p>
                   <p> <b style="color:#6f4a8e;">Metals:</b> <br>i) Metal are the element that conduct heat and electricity ,ductile and malleable .The samples of
following metals – iron, copper, aluminium, magnesium, sodium, lead,
zinc and any other metal that is easily available.<br>ii)Metals are the elements which form positive ions by losing electrons. Thus, metals are known as Electropositive Elements. </p>
                    <p> <b style="color:#6f4a8e;">PHYSICAL PROPERTIES METALS:</b> <br>

                            •	<b style="color:#6f4a8e;">Hardness:</b> Most of the metals are hard, except alkali metals, such as sodium, potassium, lithium, etc. are very soft metals. These can be cut by using a knife.<br>
•	<b style="color:#6f4a8e;">Strength:</b> Most of the metals are strong and have high tensile strength. Because of this, big structures are made using metals, such as copper (Cu) and iron (Fe). (Except Sodium (Na) and potassium (K) which are soft metals).<br>
.    <b style="color:#6f4a8e;">lustre</b> Metal have a shining surface. This property is  called metallic lustre<br>
•	<b style="color:#6f4a8e;">State: </b>Metals are solid at room temperature except for mercury (Hg).<br>
•	<b style="color:#6f4a8e;">Sonorous </b> Metals produce ringing sound, so, metals are called Sonorous. Sound of metals is also known as Metallic sound. This is the cause that metal wires are used in making musical instruments.<br>
•	<b style="color:#6f4a8e;">Conduction:</b> Metals are a good conductor of heat and electricity..<br>
•	<b style="color:#6f4a8e;">Malleability:</b> Metals are malleable. This means metals can be beaten into a thin sheet. .<br>
•	<b style="color:#6f4a8e;">Ductility: </b> Metals are ductile. This means metals can be drawn into thin wire. Because of this property, a wire is made of metals.<br>
•	<b style="color:#6f4a8e;">Melting and Boiling Point:</b> Metals have generally high melting and boiling points. (Except sodium and potassium metals which have low melting and boiling point.)<br>
•	<b style="color:#6f4a8e;">Density: </b> Most of the metals have a high density.<br>
•	<b style="color:#6f4a8e;">Colour: </b> Most of the metals are grey in colour. except gold and copper

                     <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;">Non-Metals:</b> <br>i) Non metal are elements that  do not conduct electricity and heat and they are neither ductility<br>ii) Non metals are the elements which form negetive ions by gaining electrons. Thus, metals are known as Electronegetive Elements. </p>
                      <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;">PHYSICAL PROPERTIES NON-METALS:</b><br>i) Non metals  do not show the properties of melleabilty and ductile <br>ii)Non metal do not conduct heat and electricity<br>iii)Non metal are generally soft except diamond <br>iv)Non metal do not so lustrous properties but Iodine is a non-metal but it is lustrous<br>v)  Non metal have very low melting point and boiling point except diamond</p>
                       <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;">CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF METALS:</b> <br>

                         Almost all metals combine with oxygen to form metal oxides.<br>
                         Metal + Oxygen → Metal oxide<br>

                   Ans:  potassium and sodium react so
vigorously that they catch fire if kept in the open. So  they are kept immersed in kerosene oil<br>

                                <p>Ans:Hydrogen gas is not evolved when a metal reacts with nitric acid. It is
because HNO<sub>3</sub> is a strong oxidising agent. It oxidises the H<sub>2</sub> produced to
water </p>
                                 <p><b> magnesium (Mg) and manganese (Mn) react with very dilute

decreasing activities<br><img class="Q2ch3-5n" src="/Pathanto/image/reactive.jpg"><br></p>
                                    <p> <b style="color:#6f4a8e;"> How Do Metals and Non-metals React:</b> <br> When metal react with non metal they form ionic compounds<br>

                                    Metals lose valence electron(s) and form cations.<br>
Non-metals gain those electrons in their valence shell and form anions.<br>
The cation and the anion are attracted to each other by strong electrostatic force, thus forming an ionic bond.<br>
For example: In Sodium Chloride the ionic bond is formed by opposite charged Sodium and chloride ions.
 sodium atom has one electron in its outermost shell. If it loses the electron from its M shell then its L shell
now becomes the outermost shell and that has a stable octet. The nucleus of this atom still has 11 protons but the number of electrons has become 10, so there is a net positive charge giving us a sodium cation  Na<sup>+</sup>. On the other hand chlorine has seven electrons in its outermost shell and it requires one more electron to complete its octet. If sodium and chlorine
were to react, the electron lost by sodium could be taken up by chlorine.
After gaining an electron, the chlorine atom gets a unit negative charge,
because its nucleus has 17 protons and there are 18 electrons in its K, L
and M shells. This gives us a chloride anion C1<sup>–</sup><br>

                                      <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;"> Properties of Ionic Compounds:</b> <br>
                                        <ul><li><b style="color:#6f4a8e;"> Physical nature::</b>  Ionic compounds are solids and are somewhat
hard because of the strong force of attraction between the positive
and negative ions. These compounds are generally brittle and
break into pieces when pressure is applied</li>
                                        <li><b style="color:#6f4a8e;"> Melting and Boiling points: :</b> Ionic compounds have high melting
and boiling points . This is because a considerable
amount of energy is required to break the strong inter-ionic
attraction </li>
                                        <li><b style="color:#6f4a8e;"> Solubility: </b>Electrovalent compounds are generally soluble in
water and insoluble in solvents such as kerosene, petrol, etc. </li>
                                        <li><b style="color:#6f4a8e;"> Conduction of Electricity: </b>ionic compounds conduct
electricity in the molten state. This is possible in the molten state
since the elecrostatic forces of attraction between the oppositely
charged ions are overcome due to the heat. Thus, the ions move
freely and conduct electricity </li></ul>

Metal is deposited.<br>

At the anode (oxidation):<br>
2Cl<sup>-</sup>(molten)  <span class="arrow">&rarr;</span>  Cl<sub>2</sub>(g) + 2e<sup>-</sup><br>
Chlorine gas is liberated.<br></p>
   <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;"> Refining of Metals:</b> <br>The process of purifying impure metal is  called refining of metal</p>
   <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;"> Electrolytic Refining:</b></p>
   <p>Metals like copper, zinc, nickel, silver, tin, gold etc., are refined electrolytically.<br>
<b style="color:#6f4a8e;"> Anode:</b> impure or crude metal<br>
<b style="color:#6f4a8e;"> Cathode:</b> a thin strip of pure metal<br>
<b style="color:#6f4a8e;"> Electrolyte:</b> aqueous solution of metal salt<br>

<b style="color:#6f4a8e;"> From anode (oxidation):</b> metal ions are released into the solution<br>
<b style="color:#6f4a8e;"> At cathode (reduction):</b> the equivalent amount of metal from solution is deposited
Impurities deposit at the bottom of the anode</p>
   <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;"> CORROSION</b><br> The eating up of metal by action of air moisture or  a chemical on their surface are called corrosion</p>
    <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;"> Alloy</b><br> A homogeneous mixture of two or more metal or metal and non-metal are called alloy<br>Examples of  alloys &#8211;<br />
Brass: copper and zinc<br />
Bronze: copper and tin<br />
Solder: lead and tin<br /><br><b style="color:#6f4a8e;"> Amalgam</b><br> Special class of alloys in which there is mixture of metal and mercury</p>
   <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;"> Rusting of Iron</b><br>Rust is an iron oxide, a usually reddish brown oxide formed by the reaction of iron and oxygen in the presence of water or air moisture.</p>
   <p>4Fe(s)+3O<sub>2</sub>(from air)+<em>x</em>H<sub>2</sub>O(moisture)→2Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. <em>x</em>H2O(rust)</p>
   <p> <b style="color:#6f4a8e;"> Prevention of Corrosion:</b><br>i)The rusting of iron can be prevented by painting, oiling, greasing,<br>ii)Galvanisation is a method of protecting steel and iron from rusting
by coating them with a thin layer of zinc<br>iii)Rusting of iorn can be prevented by alloying it to make stainless steal <br>iv)Rusting of iorn can be prevented by tin-plating</p>
