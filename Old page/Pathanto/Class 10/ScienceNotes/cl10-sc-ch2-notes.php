                      <p>    Compound are classified into three group on the basis of their chemical properties<br> i)Acids <br> ii)Bases <br> iii) Salts</p>
                      <p> <b style="color:#6f4a8e;">Indicators:</b><br>An indicators are used for testing a substance wheather it is acid or base by change in its colour .There are three most common indicators are use to testing for acid and bases are following <br>
                       i) Litmus <br>
                       ii)Methyle orange<br>
                       iii)Phenolphthealein<br><br></p><br>

                      <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;">Litmus paper:</b><br> Litmus can used in form of paper. there are two type of Litmus paper <br> i) Red Litmus paper <br> ii) blue Litmus paper<br>  When a  <b style="color:#6f4a8e;">blue</b> Litmus  turn into <b style="color:#6f4a8e;">red</b> the it is acidic in nature and when <b style="color:#6f4a8e;">red</b> Litmus turn into <b style="color:#6f4a8e;">blue</b> then it is basic in nature </p>
                      <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;">Methyle orange:</b><br> Methyle orange  indicator give red color in acid solution and yellow colour in basic solution<br><b style="color:#6f4a8e;">Phenolphthealein:</b><br> Phenolphthealein indicator is colourless in acid solution and pink colour in basic solution</p>
                      <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;">Olfactory Indicators:</b><br> The substance whose smell change in acidic or  basic solution are known as olfactory indicator . The following olfactory indicator are:<br>i)<b style="color:#6f4a8e;">Onion</b> When basic solution is added to cloth strip treated with onion the onion smell cannot detectd but in case of acidic solution smell can be detected because it cannot destroy the smell of onion <br> ii) <b style="color:#6f4a8e;">Vanilla</b> vanilla has a pleasant smell. if  basic solution is added to vanilla extract the we cannot detected smell  but in case of acidic solution smell can be detected because it cannot destroy the smell of vanilla extrac</p>
                      <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;"><h4>Acids</h4></b><br>


                         <ul> <li>The chemical substance which are sour in test are called acids<br></li>
                         <li> Acids are the substance which when we dissolve in water produce H<sup>+</sup> (aq) or hydronium ions (H<sub>3</sub> O<sup>+</sup> )as the only positive charged ions  e.g HCl</li>
                         <li> Acid Solution cunduct electricity </li>

                         i)All the Inorganic(mineral) acid  like Hydrochloric acid , sulphuric acid  etc are strong acid except carbonic acids This is because it completely ionised in water and produce large amount of hydrogen ions <br> 
                          ii) All organic acid  like citric acid , acetic acids etc are weak acid This is because it is partially  ionised in water and produce small amount of hydrogen ions</p>

                        Ans: acids do not show acidic behaviour in the absence of water because acid do not form hydrogen ions <br>

                      <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;">Universal indicator</b><br>
A universal indicator is a mixture of many different indicator which has a pH range from 0 to 14 that indicates the acidity or alkalinity of a solution.
A neutral solution has pH=7<br>

<b style="color:#6f4a8e;">pH</b><br>
 pH value of solution is given as pH= -log[H<sup>+</sup>] where [H<sup>+</sup>] = molar concentration of [H<sup>+</sup>] ion in solution<br>
pure water, [H<sup>+</sup>]=[OH<sup>âˆ’</sup>]=10âˆ’7 mol/L. Hence, the pH of pure water is 7.<br>
The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14.<br>
If pH rane 0- 6 : acidic solution<br>
If pH=7 Neutral Solution<br>
If pH rang 8- 14 : basic solution </p>

                      <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;"><h4> pH in Everyday Life</h4></b><br><b style="color:#6f4a8e;"> plants and animals pH sensitive</b><br>Our body works within the pH range of 7.0 to 7.8. Living organisms can
survive only in a narrow range of pH change. When pH of rain water is
less than 5.6, it is called acid rain. When acid rain flows into the rivers, it
lowers the pH of the river water. The survival of aquatic life in such rivers
becomes difficult.</p>
                      <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;">pH in our digestive system</b><br>
                              our stomach produces hydrochloric
acid. It helps in the digestion of food without harming the stomach.
During indigestion the stomach produces too much acid and this causes
pain and irritation. To get rid of this pain, people use bases called
<b style="color:#6f4a8e;">antacids.</b> 


                      </p>
                      <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;">pH of a soil</b><br>
The pH of a soil optimal for the growth of plants or crops is 6.5 to 7.0.</p>
                      <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;">pH change as the cause of tooth decay</b><br>Tooth decay starts when the pH of the mouth is lower than 5.5. Bacteria present in the mouth produce acids by
degradation of sugar and food particles remaining in the mouth after
eating. The best way to prevent this is to clean the mouth after eating
food. Using toothpastes, which are generally basic, for cleaning the teeth
can neutralise the excess acid and prevent tooth decay.</p>
                      <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;">Self defence by animals and plants through chemical warfare</b><br>Bee-sting leaves an acid
which causes pain and irritation. Use of a mild base like baking soda
on the stung area gives relief. Stinging hair of nettle leaves inject
methanoic acid causing burning pain.</p>

(sodium hydrogencarbonate) and a mild edible acid such as
tartaric acid. When baking powder is heated or mixed in water,
the following reaction takes place â€“<br>
NaHCO<sub>3</sub> + H<sup>+</sup> â†’ CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O + Sodium salt of acid<br>

Carbon dioxide produced during the reaction causes bread or cake
to rise making them soft and spongy.<br>
(ii) Sodium hydrogencarbonate is also an ingredient in antacids.
Being alkaline, it neutralises excess acid in the stomach and
provides relief.<br>
(iii) It is also used in soda-acid fire extinguishers.

                      i) Washing soda is a transparent crystalline solid<br>
                      ii) it is soluble in water<br>

                      <b style="color:#6f4a8e;">Uses of washing soda</b><br>
(i) Sodium carbonate (washing soda) is used in glass, soap and
paper industries.<br>
(ii) It is used in the manufacture of sodium compounds such as borax.<br>
(iii) Sodium carbonate can be used as a cleaning agent for domestic
purposes.<br>
(iv) It is used for removing permanent hardness of water<br>
