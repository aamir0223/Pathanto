          <p> The  wast meterial produced by the various activityies of human and animal are poisonous to some extend and can be divided two main groups<br>i) Biodegradable Wastes <br>ii)Non-Biodegradable Wastes </p>
          <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;"> Biodegradable Wastes:</b><br>Substances that are broken down by biological processes are said
to be biodegradable.</p>
          <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;"> Non-Biodegradable Wastes:</b><br>Substances that are not broken down in this manner
are said to be non-biodegradable. These substances may be inert and
simply persist in the environment for a long time or may harm the various
members of the eco-system</p>
          <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;"> ECO-SYSTEM:</b><br>All organisms such as plants, animals, microorganisms and human
beings interact with each other
and maintain a balance in nature. All the interacting organisms in an
area together with the non-living constituents of the environment form
an ecosystem.</p>
          <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;"> Component of eco-systems  :</b><br>i)Biotic component<br>ii) Abiotic Component </p>
          <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;"> i)Biotic component :</b><br>Living organisms of the environment like the  human ,plants, animals, microbes, and fungi<br>
          It includes three types of organisms <br>i) Producers<br>ii)  Consumers<br>iii)  Decomposers:</p>
          <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;"> Producers  :</b><br>The autotrophs organism are also called producers because they  can produce their food  from inorganic substance using light energy  called Photosynthesis.for example plant blue green algae</p>

          <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;">  Consumers  :</b><br>These organisms which consume the food produced,
either directly from producers or indirectly by feeding on other consumers
are the consumers.<br>The consumers can be classified into the following types :<br>i)Herbivores <br> ii)Carnivores <br>iii)Omnivores</p>
          <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;"> Herbivores  :</b>hese are organisms  which get their food by eating the green plant only . ex- rabbit, goats</p>
          <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;"> Omnivores  :</b>The organisms who eat both plants and animals are called omnivores ex-human</p>
          <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;">  Carnivores:   :</b>hese are organisms  which consume other animals.ex-tiger, lion,</p>
          <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;"> Decomposers:  :</b>Decomposers break down the organic matter or waste material and release nutrients into the soil.  For example, bacteria, worms, slugs, and snails.</p>
         


          <p>Planktons are very minute or microscopic organisms freely floating on the surface of water in a pond, lake, river or ocean. Planktons are of two types : Phytoplanktons and Zooplanktons.</p>

          <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;"> phytoplanktons.  :</b>The microscopic aquatic plants freely floating on the surface of water are called phytoplanktons.</p>
          <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;"> zooplanktons:</b>The microscopic aquatic animals freely floating on water are called zooplanktons. The freely floating protozoa are an example of zooplankton</p>
          <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;"> Abiotic Components:  :</b>These are non-living components of an ecosystem like water rock etc</p>

          <b style="color:#6f4a8e;"> Food web  :</b>Each organism is
generally eaten by two or more other
kinds of organisms which in turn this series
of branching lines called a food web<br><img class="Q2ch3-5n" src="/Pathanto/image/food-web.JPG"><br><br>





          <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;"> Food Chain :</b>The sequence of living organisms in a community in which one organism consumes another organism to transfer food energy, is called a food chain.<br><img class="Q2ch3-5n" src="/Pathanto/image/food-chain.JPG"><br><br></p>
          <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;"> Trophic level  :</b>Each step or level of the food chain forms a trophic level<br>i)The autotrophs or the producers are at the first trophic level.<br>ii)The herbivores or the primary
consumers come at the second<br>iii)small carnivores or the
secondary consumers at the third <br>iv)the tertiary consumers form the fourth trophic level</p>
a) Pyramid of numbers: gives the number of organisms present at each trophic level.
It can be upright or inverted.<br>
b) Pyramid of biomass: gives the biomass of each trophic levels and could be upright or inverted.<br>
c) Pyramid of energy: is always upright as it shows the flow of energy from one trophic level to the next trophic level<br><br><img class="Q2ch3-5n" src="/Pathanto/image/energy.png" width="300" height="200"><br><br>

              <b style="color:#6f4a8e;"> Energy flow:</b>
Transfer of energy from one trophic level to another depicting its direction and amount<br>
          <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;"> Ozone Layer and How it is Getting Depleted :</b><br>Ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) is a molecule formed by three atoms of oxygen. While O2,
which we normally refer to as oxygen, is essential for all aerobic forms of
life. Ozone, is a deadly poison. However, at the higher levels of the
atmosphere, ozone performs an essential function. It shields the surface
of the earth from ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the Sun. This radiation
is highly damaging to organisms, for example, it is known to cause skin
cancer in human beings<br><br>ii) Ozone at the higher levels of the atmosphere is a product of UV
radiation acting on oxygen (O2) molecule. The higher energy UV
radiations split apart some moleculer oxygen (O2) into free oxygen (O)
atoms<br>
<b>The amount of ozone in the atmosphere began to drop sharply due use of 
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) </b></p>
          <p> <b style="color:#6f4a8e;">Managing the Garbage :</b>The disposal of waste should be done in a scientific way. The method to be used depends on the nature of the waste. Some of the important modes of waste disposal are :<br>i)Segregation of waste<br>
ii) Collection<br>
iii) Transport<br>
iv) Treatment<br>
v) Processing & Recycling<br>
vi) Disposal</p>
