          <p>
The sources of energy which have been in use from a long time are called conventional sources of energy</p>
           <p>There are two type of sources of energy:</p>
            <p>i) Renewable Energy</p>
         <p>ii) Non-Renewable Energy</p>
         <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;">i) Renewable Energy:</b>  The resources
which can be renewed or reproduced by
physical, chemical or mechanical processes
are known as renewable For example, solar and wind
energy, water,</p>
           <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;">ii) Non-Renewable Energy:</b> These occur over
a very long geological time. Minerals and fossil
fuels are examples of such resources. These
resources take millions of years in their
formation.  like fossil fuels </p>
           <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;">WHAT IS A GOOD SOURCE OF ENERGY?:</b><br>A good source of energy would be one<br>
 which would do a large amount of work per unit volume or mass,<br>
be easily accessible,<br>
 be easy to store and transport<br>
 perhaps most importantly, be economical</p>
          <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;">Fuels:</b> The substance which are burn to produced heat energy is called fuels like LPG ,CNG ,wood etc<br></p><p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;">Good  or Ideal fuel  :</b><br>i)A good source of should be one:<br>

ii)Easily available<br>
iii)Easy to store and transport<br>
iv)proper ignition temperature<br>v)It should have a high calorific value</p>
          <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;">CONVENTIONAL SOURCES OF ENERGY:</b> <br> The traditional source of energy which are used most of people are known as conventional sources of energy like  wood, coal</p>
           <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;">Fossil fuels:</b>Fossil fuels are formed due to compression of dead organic matter(plant and animals) over millions of years  deep under the earth example coal or natural gas.<br>ii)The fossil fuels are non-renewable
sources of energy, so we need to conserve
them and we need to find alternate sources of energy </p>
            <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;">Disadvantages of fossil fuels:</b> i) The oxides of carbon, nitrogen and sulphur that are released on burning
fossil fuels are acidic oxides. These lead to acid rain which affects our
water and soil resources<br>ii) the air pollution caused by burning of coal or petroleum products.<br>iii)The burning of fossil fuel produced high amount od CO<sub>2</sub> and other gases Which caused  green-house effect</p>
             <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;">Controlling pollution : </b>The pollution caused by burning fossil fuels can be reduced
by increasing the efficiency of the combustion process and using various
techniques like  catalytic converter</p>
          <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;">Thermal power plants:</b>Thermal power plants use steam produced by burning fossil fuels ( coal, oil gas) to move the turbines to generate electricity. are known as thermal power plants<br>ii) The transmission of electricity is more efficient than
transporting coal or petroleum over the same distance so  many
thermal power plants are set up near coal or oil fields. <br>iii) The burning of coal heat up water to produce steam which  runs the turbine to
generate electricity.</p>

          <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;"> Hydro Power Plants:</b><br><br><img class="Q2ch3-5n" src="/Pathanto/image/hydro.JPG" width="600"><br><br><ul><li> Hydro power plants
convert the potential energy of falling water into electricity</li>
<li>Another traditional source of energy was the kinetic energy of flowing
water or the potential energy of water at a height</li><li>In order to produce hydel electricity,
high-rise dams are constructed on the river so collect water in larger reservoirs</li><li>The falling/flowing water moves the turbine, which with the help of a dynamo converts mechanical energy into electrical energy.</li></ul></p>
           <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;">Advantages:</b><br>i)hydro
power is a renewable source of energy which never get exhausted<br>ii)Dam help in contolling flood, and in irrigation </p>
            <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;">Disadvantage:</b><br>i)The dams can be constructed only in a limited number of places,
preferably in hilly terrains<br>ii)Large areas of agricultural land and human
habitation are to be sacrificed as they get submerged.<br>iii)Large eco-systems
are destroyed when submerged under the water in dams</p>
         <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;">Conventional Sources of Energy:</b></p>
           <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;">Bio-Mass:</b>cow-dung, various plant materials like the residue after
harvesting the crops, vegetable waste and sewage are decomposed in
the absence of oxygen to give bio-gas<br><br>
<b style="color:#6f4a8e;">Biogas Plant:</b><br><br><img class="Q2ch3-5n" src="/Pathanto/image/bio-gas.jpg" width="600"><br><br>
<ul><li>The plant has a dome-like structure built with
bricks</li>
<li>A slurry of cow-dung and water is made in
the mixing tank from where it is fed into the digester.</li>
<li>The digester is a sealed chamber in which there is no
oxygen</li>
<li>Anaerobic micro-organisms that do not
require oxygen decompose or break down complex
compounds of the cow-dung slurry. when decomposition process to be complete
and generate gases like methane, carbon dioxide,
hydrogen and hydrogen sulphide.</li>
<li>The bio-gas is
stored in the gas tank above the digester from which
they are drawn through pipes for use</li>

</ul></p>
<b style="color:#6f4a8e;">Advantages:</b><br>

i)Bio-gas is an excellent fuel as it contains up to 75% methane<br>
ii)The slurry left behind is removed periodically and used as excellent
manure, rich in nitrogen and phosphorous<br>
           <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;">Wind Energy:</b>This kinetic energy of the wind
can be used  to generate electricity.</p>
          <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;">Windmill:</b><br><br><img class="Q2ch3-5n" src="/Pathanto/image/wind.JPG" height ="300" width="300"><br><br>i)Wind Energy is harnessed by rotatory structures known as windmills.<br>ii)To generate electricity, the rotatory motion of the windmill
is used to turn the turbine of the electric generator</p>
<b style="color:#6f4a8e;">Advantages:</b> Wind energy is an environment-friendly and efficient source of
renewable energy
          <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;">Limitation:</b> <br>i) High  cost  regular maintenance are required<br>ii) Large land area requires for installing windmill farm<br>iii)The wind speed should also be
higher than 15 km/h to maintain the required speed of the turbine </p>
           <p> <b style="color:#6f4a8e;">ALTERNATIVE OR  NON-CONVENTIONAL CONVENTIONAL
SOURCES OF ENERGY:</b></p>

            <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;">Solar Energy:</b><br>
           </p>
            <ul>
            <li>The Sun has been radiating an enormous amount of energy at the present
rate for nearly 5 billion years and will continue radiating at that rate for
about 5 billion years more</li>
            <li> The energy produce from the sun light is called solar eneergy</li>
          </ul>
             <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;">Solar Cooker:</b><br><br><img class="Q2ch3-5n" src="/Pathanto/image/soler-cooker.jpg" width="300"><br><br> The solar cooker is a device which is used to cooked food by heating energy radiated by the sun</p>
          <p><ul><li>A black surface absorbs more heat as
compared to other surface and   solar cookers use this property by coating their insides black.</li>
<li>solar cookers
achieve a higher temperature by using mirrors
to focus the rays of the Sun</li>

</ul></p>
          <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;">solar cell:</b>

           <p> <b style="color:#6f4a8e;"> Energy from the Sea:</b></p>
          <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;"> Tidal Energy:</b><br>i) The phenomenon of  high and low tides
and the difference in sea-levels gives is called tidal energy<br>ii)Tidal energy is
harnessed by constructing a dam across a narrow opening to the sea<br>iii)A
turbine fixed at the opening of the dam converts tidal energy to electricity.</p>
          <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;"> Wave Energy:</b><br>the kinetic energy possessed by huge waves near the seashore can be used to generate electricity<br>ii)The waves are generated by strong winds blowing across the sea.<br>iii) devices have used to trap wave energy for
rotation of turbine and production of electricity.</p>
           <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;"> Ocean Thermal Energy:</b><br>i) This difference in
temperature is exploited to obtain energy in ocean-thermal-energy
conversion plants<br>ii)the temperature difference
between the water at the surface and water at depths up to 2 km is
293 K (20Â°C) or more.<br>iii)The warm surface-water is used to boil a volatile
liquid like ammonia. The vapours of the liquid are then used to run the
turbine of generator. </p>
            <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;"> Geothermal Energy:</b><br>Due to geological changes, molten rocks formed in the deeper hot regions
of earthâ€™s crust are pushed upward and trapped in  hot spots Harnessing this heat energy is called geothermal energy.<br>ii)The steam trapped
in rocks is routed through a pipe to a turbine and used to generate
electricity</p>
             <p> <b style="color:#6f4a8e;"> Nuclear Energy:</b>Nuclear energy can be used to generate electricity by the process of nuclear fission.</p>
          <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;"> nuclear fission:</b><br>when bombarded with low-energy neutrons, can be split apart into lighter
nuclei. When this is done, a tremendous amount of energy is released  The fission of an atom of uranium,
for example, produces 10 million times the energy produced by the
combustion of an atom of carbon from coal.</p>
<p> <b style="color:#6f4a8e;">Nuclear fusion:</b><br> i)Fusion means joining lighter nuclei to make a heavier nucleus, most commonly
hydrogen or hydrogen isotopes to create helium<br>ii) It releases a tremendous amount of energy, according to the Einstein equation</p>

          
<p> <b style="color:#6f4a8e;"> Disadvantages:</b><br>i)The major hazard of nuclear power generation is the storage and  decaying into harmful
subatomic particles (radiations).<br>ii) The high cost of installation
of a nuclear power plant<br>iii)Limited availability of uranium<br>iv)Nuclear energy was first used for destructive purposes   </p>
