      <p> <b style="color:#6f4a8e;">ELECTRIC MOTOR:</b><br>An electric motor is a rotating device that converts electrical energy to
mechanical energy.</p>
      <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;">Principle:</b><br> when a rectangular coil is placed in a magnetic field and current is passed through it, a force acts on the coil which rotates it continuously.</p>
      <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;">Construction:</b><br><img class="Q2ch3-5n" src="/Pathanto/image/motor.png" width="100%" height="400"><br><br> An electric motor,  consists of a rectangular
coil ABCD of insulated copper wire. The coil is placed between the two
poles of a magnetic field such that the arm AB and CD are perpendicular
to the direction of the magnetic field. The
ends of the coil are connected to the two
halves P and Q of a split ring. The inner sides
of these halves are insulated and attached
to an axle. The external conducting edges of
P and Q touch two conducting stationary
brushes X and Y, respectively,</p>
      <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;">Working:</b> Current in the coil ABCD enters from the
source battery through conducting brush
X and flows back to the battery through
brush Y. the current in arm AB
of the coil flows from A to B. In arm CD it
flows from C to D, that is, opposite to the
direction of current through arm AB. On
applying Fleming’s left hand rule for the
direction of force on a current-carrying conductor in a magnetic field  the force
acting on arm AB pushes it downwards while the force acting on arm
CD pushes it upwards and it  rotate anti-clockwise. At half rotation, Q makes
contact with the brush X and P with brush Y. the current in
the coil gets reversed and flows along the path DCBA. The
reversal of current also reverses the direction of force acting on the two
arms AB and CD. so it pushed down. Therefore the coil and the axle rotate half a turn more in
the same direction. The reversing of the current is repeated at each half
rotation, giving rise to a continuous rotation of the coil and to the axle</p>
      <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;">Power Source:</b> A simple motor usually has a DC power source.  It supplies power to the motor armature or field coils.<br>
<b style="color:#6f4a8e;">Commutator:</b> A device that
reverses the direction of flow of current through a circuit is called a
commutator.<br>
<b style="color:#6f4a8e;">Field Magnet</b> The magnetic field helps to produce a torque on the rotating armature coil by virtue of Fleming’s left-hand rule.<br>

<b style="color:#6f4a8e;">Brushes::</b> It is a device that conducts current between stationary wires and moving parts, most commonly the rotating shaft</p>
      <p> <b style="color:#6f4a8e;">The commercial motors use:</b>(i) an electromagnet in place of permanent
magnet; <br>(ii) large number of turns of the conducting wire in the currentcarrying coil; <br> (iii) a soft iron core on which the coil is wound.</p>
      <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;">ELECTROMAGNETIC INDUCTION:</b> </p>
      <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;">Faraday’s experiment:</b><br>
      <img class="Q2ch3-5n" src="/Pathanto/image/magnet.jpg"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<img class="Q2ch3-5n" src="/Pathanto/image/magnet1.jpg"><br><br>
Faraday discovered that a magnetic field communicat with an electric circuit by inducing a voltage known a electromotive force  by electromagnetic induction.<br>When a strong bar magnet is moved toward the coil  the galvanometer show deflection </p>
      <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;">Electromagnetic induction:</b>The phenomenon of   production  induced EMF  due to change in  magnetic field  with close circuit</p>
      <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;">Fleming’s right-hand rule:</b><br>  <br><img class="Q2ch3-5n" src="/Pathanto/image/right.png"><br><br> If we stretch  the thumb, forefinger and middle finger of the right hand mutually perpendicular to each other and If the thumb indicates the direction of the movement of conductor, fore-finger indicating direction of the magnetic field, then the middle finger indicates direction of the induced curren</p>
      <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;">ELECTRIC GENERATOR:</b><br>A generator converts mechanical energy into electrical energy</p>

     <br><img class="Q2ch3-5n" src="/Pathanto/image/electric-generator.png" width="100%" height="400"><br><br> 



      <p> <b style="color:#6f4a8e;">Principle:</b>It is base on principle of electromagnetic induction such that when a straight conductor is moved in a magnetic field then currentis induced in conductor</p>
     <b style="color:#6f4a8e;">Constuction:</b> An electric generator  consists of a rotating
rectangular coil ABCD placed between the two poles of a permanent
magnet. The two ends of this coil are connected to
the two rings R1 and R2. The inner side of these
rings are made insulated. The two conducting
stationary brushes B1 and B2 are kept pressed
separately on the rings R1 and R2, respectively. The
two rings R1 and R2 are internally attached to an
axle. The axle may be mechanically rotated from
outside to rotate the coil inside the magnetic field.
Outer ends of the two brushes are connected to
the galvanometer to show the flow of current in the
given external circuit.

      <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;">Working:</b> The rotating the loop in a magnetic field, the side AB moves upward and the side CD moves downwards respectively in the produced magnetic field. Thus,  current is induced in it whose direction can be determined by Flemings right hand rule.
After half rotation, the ring P comes in contact with brush Y and the ring Q, comes in contact with brush X. Thus, the brush X is always in contact with the side moving upwards and brush Y is always in contact with side moving downwards as a result of which the current flows in one direction. This current is called direct current. This type of generator is called D.C. generator. Similarly, instead of a half ring, if a full ring is used then, A.C. current can be generated and such a generator is called an A.C. generator.</p>
      <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;">Note: The difference between the direct and alternating currents is that the
direct current always flows in one direction, whereas the alternating
current reverses its direction periodically. </b></p>
      <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;"> DOMESTIC ELECTRIC CIRCUITS:</b></p>
               <br><img class="Q2ch3-5n" src="/Pathanto/image/earth.jpg"><br><br>

         i)AC  electric power of 220 V receive in our house  with a frequency of 50 Hz.<br>
         ii)Earth wire has a voltage of 0V and is covered with green insulation
<p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;"> Electric Fuse </b><br><img class="Q2ch3-5n" src="/Pathanto/image/fuse.jpg"  width="300" height="150"><br> i) Overloading can occur when the live wire and the neutral wire come into direct contact. This
occurs when the insulation of wires is damaged or there is a fault in the appliance<br>
ii)The use of an electric fuse
prevents the electric circuit and the appliance from a possible damage
by stopping the flow of unduly high electric current<br>
iii) overloading the current in circuit increases  and becomes hazardous. Joule’s heating in the fuse device melts the circuit and breaks the flow of current in the circuit<br>

iv)Fuse work as  protective device in an electrical circuit in times of overloading. when we too many appliances of high power rating are used at the same time </p>
