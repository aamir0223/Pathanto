           <p>Any object and things in the environment which can be used is called a natural resource</p>
          <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;"> Types of Resources :</b><br>
(a) <b style="color:#6f4a8e;">Exhaustible :</b>These occur over
a very long geological time and  present in limited quantity. Minerals and fossil
fuels are examples of such resources  like fossil fuels  e.g. coal petroleum.<br>

(b) <b style="color:#6f4a8e;"> Inexhaustible :</b> The resources
which present in unlimited quantity  can be renewed or reproduced by
physical, chemical or mechanical processes
are known as inexhaustible For example, solar , air, water<br></p>
          <p> <b style="color:#6f4a8e;"> Ganga Pollution : </b>Multi Crore Project came in 1985 to improve the quality of Ganga<br>a survey was conducted and data was collected for total coliform (a group of bacteria found in human intestine) and acidic water  between 1993-1994 which was as below<br>Dumping of untreated sewage,  excreta, and chemicals from industries increases the toxicity of the water.</p>
          <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;"> Reduce, recycle and reuse </b><br>the three R’s to save the environment:</p>
          <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;"> Reduce  </b>This means that you use less.Eg. save electricity by switching
off unnecessary lights and fans.save water by repairing
leaky taps. not waste food. </p>
          <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;"> Recycle </b>This means that  collect plastic, paper etc. items and recycle these materials to make required things
instead of synthesising </p>
          <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;"> Reuse </b> Using things again instead of discarding them.</p>
          <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;">Sustainable development </b>Sustainable development is a development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs</p>
          <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;">  WHY DO WE NEED TO MANAGE OUR RESOURCES? </b> <br>i )the human population increasing at a
tremendous rate due to improvement in health-care, the demand for all
resources is increasing at an exponential rate.<br>ii)We must ensure  use of our natural resources as it is not unlimited and management of such requires long-term planning in order to last generations.<br>iii)mining causes
pollution because of the large amount of slag which is discarded for
every tonne of metal extracted</p>
          <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;"> FORESTS AND WILD LIFE</b><br>Forests are ‘biodiversity hot spots’. One measure of the biodiversity of
an area is the number of species found there<br>ii)the  loss of diversity
may lead to a loss of ecological stability</p>
          <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;">Stakeholders</b><br>(i) the people who live in or around forests are dependent on forest
produce for various aspects of their life<br>
(ii) the Forest Department of the Government which owns the land
and controls the resources from forests.<br>
(iii) the industrialists – from those who use ‘tendu’ leaves to make
bidis to the ones with paper mills – who use various forest produce,
but are not dependent on the forests in any one area.<br>
(iv) the wild life and nature enthusiasts who want to conserve nature
in its pristine form</p>
            <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;"> monocultures</b><br>A single type of crop in large field ex teak or eucalyptus<br> ii) This destroys a large
amount of biodiversity in the area. <br>iii) the varied needs of the local people – leaves for fodder, herbs for medicines, fruits and nuts for
food – can no longer be met from such forests</p>
          <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;"> Industries influence</b><br>Industries would consider the forest as merely a source of raw
material for its factories <br>ii)And huge interest-groups lobby the government
for access to these raw materials at artificially low rates</p><br><ul><li>The conservationists were initially taken up with large
animals like lions, tigers, elephants and rhinoceros</li>
<li>The local people working traditionally for conservation of forests.</li>
<li>the Bishnoi community in Rajasthan, for whom
conservation of forest and wildlife has been a religious tenet.</li>
<li>Amrita Devi
Bishnoi, who protection of ‘khejri’ trees in Khejrali village near Jodhpur in Rajasthan.</li>

            <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;">Chipko movement</b><br><ul><li> The movement originated
from an incident in a remote village called Reni in Garhwal, high-up in
the Himalayas during the early 1970s.</li>
<li> There was a dispute between the
local villagers and a logging contractor who had been allowed to fell
trees in a forest close to the village</li>
<li>the women of the village reached the forest quickly
and clasped the tree trunks thus preventing the workers from felling the
trees.</li>
<li>The Chipko movement quickly spread across communities and
media, and forced the government</li>
<li>Participation of the local people can indeed lead to the efficient
management of forests.</li>
</ul></p>
        <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;"> WATER FOR ALL</b><br><ul><li> Water is a basic necessity for all terrestrial forms of life</li>
<li> regions of water scarcity are closely correlated to the regions of acute
poverty</li>
<li>Despite nature’s monsoon bounty, failure to sustain
water availability underground has resulted largely from the loss of
vegetation cover, diversion for high water demanding crops, and pollution
from industrial effluents and urban wastes.</li>
<li> Irrigation methods like dams,
tanks and canals have been used in various parts of India since ancient
times</li>
<li>
Decrease in fresh usable water due to the destruction of water table and disruption in water cycle. </li>
<li>These mega-projects led to the neglect of the
local irrigation methods, and the government </li>
<li>Regulations on usage of stored water and building tanks, dams, and canals</li>
<li>the optimum cropping patterns based
on the water availability were arrived at on the basis of decades/centuries
of experiencety </li>
</ul></p>
          <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;">Dame</b><br> Large dams can ensure the storage of
adequate water not just for irrigation, but also for generating electricity<br>Canal systems leading from these
dams can transfer large amounts of water great distances. <br><br>Criticisms about large dams address
three problems in particular –<br>(i) Social problems because they displace large number of peasants
and tribals without adequate compensation or rehabilitation,<br>
(ii) Economic problems because they swallow up huge amounts of
public money without the generation of proportionate benefits,<br>
(iii) Environmental problems because they contribute enormously
to deforestation and the loss of biological diversity.</p>
            <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;"> Water Harvesting</b><br>Watershed management emphasises scientific soil and water
conservation in order to increase the biomass production<br>ii)Watershed management not only increases the
production and income of the watershed community<br>iii)mitigates
droughts and floods and increases the life of the downstream dam and
reservoirs <br>iv)Water harvesting is an age-old concept in India. Khadins, tanks
and nadis in Rajasthan, bandharas and tals in Maharashtra, bundhis
in Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, ahars and pynes in Bihar,
kulhs in Himachal Pradesh, ponds in the Kandi belt of Jammu region,
and eris (tanks) in Tamil Nadu, surangams in Kerala, and kattas in
Karnataka are some of the ancient water harvesting,</p>
<br><img class="Q2ch3-5n" src="/Pathanto/image/harvest.png" width="600"><br><br>
        <p>the water harvesting structures are mainly
crescent shaped earthen embankments or low, straight concrete-andrubble “check dams” built across seasonally flooded gullies.<br>Monsoon
rains fill ponds behind the structures. Only the largest structures hold
water year round; most dry up six months or less after the monsoons.<br>Their main purpose, however, is not to hold surface water but to recharge
the ground water beneath. <br>br>Their main purpose, however, is not to hold surface water but to recharge
the ground water beneath. </p>

      <p><b style="color:#6f4a8e;"> COAL AND PETROLEUM</b><br><ul><li>Coal and petroleum are non-renewable natural resources.</li><li> Coal and petroleum
were formed from the degradation of bio-mass millions of years ago </li><li>Their combustion of coal and petroleum pollutes our environment due to the production of oxides of carbon, sulfur and nitrogen. so, we need to use these resources judiciously </li><li>When these are burnt, the
products are carbon dioxide, water, oxides of nitrogen and oxides of
sulphur</li><li> And the
amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is going to increase leading
to intense global warming</li></ul></p>
