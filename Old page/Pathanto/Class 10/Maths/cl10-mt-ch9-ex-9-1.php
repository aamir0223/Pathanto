<p><h6 class="question">Question 1</h6> A circus artist is climbing a 20 m long rope, which is tightly stretched and tied from the top of a vertical pole to the ground. Find the height of the pole, if the angle made by the rope with the ground level is 30°. (see fig. 9.11)
</p>
<img class="Q2ch3-5n mode" src="https://pathanto.com/Pathanto/image/cl10-ex9.1-1.png" alt="NCERT Ex-9.1 class 10"><br>
<h6 class="answer">Answer</h6>

<p>IN the figure </p>
<p>angle made by the rope with the ground level is 30° and Length of the rope is 20 m and we have to determine the height of the pole AB=?<br> So,.</p>
<p> AC = 20 m and angle θ= 30°</p>


<p>In right ΔABC,</p>
<p>sin 30° = AB/AC</p>

<p><sup> 1/2 = AB/20</sup></p>
<p><sup> AB = 20/2</sup></p>
<p><sup>AB = 10</sup></p>
<p>Therefore, the height of the pole is 10 m.</p>

<p><h6 class="question">Question 2</h6> A tree breaks due to storm and the broken part bends so that the top of the tree touches the ground making an angle 30° with it. The distance between the foot of the tree to the point where the top touches the ground is 8 m. Find the height of the tree.
</p>
<img class="Q2ch3-5n mode" src="https://pathanto.com/Pathanto/image/cl10-ex9.1-2.png" alt="NCERT Ex-9.1 class 10"><br>
<h6 class="answer">Answer</h6>
</p>
<p> Let's the original height of tree be AC   due to storm  tree broke from point .the broken part of tree is BC  touch at ground at D making  a angle 30° </p>
<p>BC = 8 m</p>
	
<p>From figure: Total height of the tree is the sum of AB and AC i.e. AB+AC</p>
<p>In right ΔABC,</p>

<p>cos30° = BC/AC</p>
<p>Here, cos 30° = √3/2</p>
<p>√3/2 = 8/AC</p>
<p>AC = 16/√3 …(1)</p>
<p>Also,</p>
<p>tan 30° = AB/BC</p>
<p>1/√3 = AB/8</p>
<p>AB = 8/√3 ….(2)</p>
<p>Therefore, total height of the tree = AB + AC = 16/√3 + 8/√3 = 24/√3 = 8√3 m.</p>

<p><h6 class="question">Question 3</h6> A contractor plans to install two slides for the children to play in a park. For the children below the age of 5 years, she prefers to have a slide whose top is at a height of 1.5 m, and is inclined at an angle of 30° to the ground, whereas for elder children, she wants to have a steep slide at a height of 3m, and inclined at an angle of 60° to the ground. What should be the length of the slide in each case?
</p>
<img class="Q2ch3-5n mode" src="https://pathanto.com/Pathanto/image/cl10-ex9.1-3.png" alt="NCERT Ex-9.1 class 10"><br>
<h6 class="answer">Answer</h6>
<p>As per contractor’s plan,</p>

<p>Let AC is the slide for the children below the age of 5 yr</p>
<p>So , BC=1.5 ∠CAB=30° </p>

<p>In right ΔABC,</p>
<p>sin 30° = AB/AC</p>
<p>1/2 = 1.5/AC</p>
<p>AC = 3</p>	

<p>Let PR is the slide for the children below the age of elder child</p>
<p>So , PQ=3m ∠QPR=60° </p>

<p>Also,</p>
<p>In right ΔPQR,</p>
<p>sin 60° = PQ/PR</p>
<p>⇒ √3/2 = 3/PR</p>
<p>⇒ PR = 2√3</p>
<p>Hence, length of the slide for below 5 = 3 m and</p>
<p>Length of the slide for elders children = 2√3 m</p>


<p><h6 class="question">Question 4</h6> The angle of elevation of the top of a tower from a point on the ground, which is 30 m away from the foot of the tower, is 30°. Find the height of the tower.
</p>
<img class="Q2ch3-5n mode" src="https://pathanto.com/Pathanto/image/cl10-ex9.1-4.png" alt="NCERT Ex-9.1 class 10"><br>
<h6 class="answer">Answer</h6>

<p>Let AB be the height of the tower and C is the point elevation which is 30 m away from the foot of the tower.</p>
<p> here ∠ACB=30° </p>
<p>In right ABC</p>
<p>tan 30° = AB/BC</p>
<p>1/√3 = AB/30</p>
<p>⇒ AB = 10√3</p>
<p>Thus, the height of the tower is 10√3 m.</p>

<p><h6 class="question">Question 5</h6> A kite is flying at a height of 60 m above the ground. The string attached to the kite is temporarily tied to a point on the ground. The inclination of the string with the ground is 60°. Find the length of the string, assuming that there is no slack in the string.
</p><img class="Q2ch3-5n mode" src="https://pathanto.com/Pathanto/image/cl10-ex9.1-5.jpeg" alt="NCERT Ex-9.1 class 10"><br>
<h6 class="answer">Answer</h6>


<p>Let BC is  Height of the kite from the ground, BC = 60 m </p>
<p>AC is length of the string from the ground which make an angle ∠ACB=60°</p>


<p>From the above figure,</p>
<p>sin 60° = BC/AC</p>
<p>⇒ √3/2 = 60/AC</p>
<p>⇒ AC = 40√3 m</p>
<p>Thus, the length of the string from the ground is 40√3 m.</p>

<p><h6 class="question">Question 6</h6> A 1.5 m tall boy is standing at some distance from a 30 m tall building. The angle of elevation from his eyes to the top of the building increases from 30° to 60° as he walks towards the building. Find the distance he walked towards the building.</p>
<img class="Q2ch3-5n mode" src="https://pathanto.com/Pathanto/image/cl10-ex9.1-6.jpeg" alt="NCERT Ex-9.1 class 10"><br>
<h6 class="answer">Answer</h6>
<p>Let the boy initially stand at point Y with inclination 30° and then he approaches the building to the point X with inclination 60°.</p>

<p>From figure,</p>
<p>XY = CD.</p>
<p>Height of the building = AZ = 30 m.</p>
<p>AB = AZ – BZ = 30 – 1.5 = 28.5</p>
<p>Measure of AB is 28.5 m</p>
<p>In right ΔABD,</p>
<p>tan 30° = AB/BD</p>
<p>1/√3 = 28.5/BD</p>
<p>BD = 28.5√3 m</p>
<p>Again,</p>
<p>In right ΔABC,</p>
<p>tan 60° = AB/BC</p>
<p>√3 = 28.5/BC</p>
<p>BC = 28.5/√3 = 28.5√3/3</p>
<p>Therefore, the length of BC is 28.5√3/3 m.</p>
<p>XY = CD = BD – BC = (28.5√3-28.5√3/3) = 28.5√3(1-1/3) = 28.5√3 × 2/3 = 57/√3 m.</p>
<p>Thus, the distance boy walked towards the building is 57/√3 m.</p>

<p><h6 class="question">Question 7</h6> From a point on the ground, the angles of elevation of the bottom and the top of a</p>

<p>transmission tower fixed at the top of a 20 m high building are 45° and 60° respectively. Find the height of the tower. 
</p>
<img class="Q2ch3-5n mode" src="https://pathanto.com/Pathanto/image/cl10-ex9.1-7.jpeg" alt="NCERT Ex-9.1 class 10"><br>
<h6 class="answer">Answer</h6>
</p>
<p>Let BC be the 20 m high building.</p>
<p>D is the point on the ground from where the elevation is taken.</p>
<p>Height of transmission tower = AB = AC – BC</p>

<p>From figure, In right ΔBCD,</p>
<p>tan 45° = BC/CD</p>
<p>1 = 20/CD</p>
<p>CD = 20</p>
<p>Again,</p>
<p>In right ΔACD,</p>
<p>tan 60° = AC/CD</p>
<p>√3 = AC/20</p>
<p>AC = 20√3</p>
<p>Now, AB = AC – BC = (20√3-20) = 20(√3-1)</p>

<p>Height of transmission tower = 20(√3 – 1) m.</p>
<p><h6 class="question">Question 8</h6>A statue, 1.6 m tall, stands on the top of a pedestal. From a point on the ground, the angle of elevation of the top of the statue is 60° and from the same point the angle of elevation of the top of the pedestal is 45°. Find the height of the pedestal.</p>
<img class="Q2ch3-5n mode" src="https://pathanto.com/Pathanto/image/cl10-ex9.1-8.jpg" alt="NCERT Ex-9.1 class 10"><br>
<h6 class="answer">Answer</h6>
</p>
<p>Let AB be the height of statue.</p>
<p>D is the point on the ground from where the elevation is taken.</p>
<p>To Find: Height of pedestal = BC = AC-AB</p>

<p>From figure,</p>
<p>In right triangle BCD,</p>
<p>tan 45° = BC/CD</p>
<p> 1 = BC/CD</p>
<p>          BC = CD …..(1)</p>
<p>Again,</p>
<p>In right ΔACD,</p>
<p>tan 60° = AC/AD</p>
<p> √3 = ( AB+BC)/CD</p>
<p> √3CD = 1.6 + BC</p>
<p> √3BC = 1.6 + BC (using equation (1)</sup></p>
<p> √3BC – BC = 1.6</p>
<p> BC(√3-1) = 1.6 </p>
<p> BC = 1.6/(√3-1) m</p>
<p> BC = 0.8(√3+1) </p>
<p>Thus, the height of the pedestal is 0.8(√3+1) m.</p>
<p><h6 class="question">Question 9</h6>The angle of elevation of the top of a building from the foot of the tower is 30° and the angle of elevation of the top of the tower from the foot of the building is 60°. If the tower is 50 m high, find the height of the building.

<p><h6 class="question">Question 10</h6> Two poles of equal heights are standing opposite each other on either side of the road, which is 80 m wide. From a point between them on the road, the angles of elevation of the top of the poles are 60° and 30°, respectively. Find the height of the poles and the distances of the point from the poles.</p>
<img class="Q2ch3-5n mode" src="https://pathanto.com/Pathanto/image/cl10-ex9.1-10.jpeg" alt="NCERT Ex-9.1 class 10"><br>
<h6 class="answer">Answer</h6>
</p>
<p>Let AB and CD be the poles of equal height.</p>
<p>O is the point between them from where the height of elevation taken. BD is the distance between the poles.</p>

<p>As per above figure, AB = CD,</p>
<p>OB + OD = 80 m</p>
<p>Now,</p>
<p>In right ΔCDO,</p>
<p>tan 30° = CD/OD</p>
<p>1/√3 = CD/OD</p>
<p>CD = OD/√3 … (1)</p>
<p>Again,</p>
<p>In right ΔABO,</p>
<p>tan 60° = AB/OB</p>
<p>√3 = AB/(80-OD)</p>
<p>AB = √3(80-OD)</p>
<p>AB = CD (Given)</p>
<p>√3(80-OD) = OD/√3 (Using equation (1))</p>
<p>3(80-OD) = OD</p>
<p>240 – 3 OD = OD</p>
<p>4 OD = 240</p>
<p>OD = 60</p>
<p>Putting the value of OD in equation (1)</p>
<p>CD = OD/√3</p>
<p>CD = 60/√3</p>
<p>CD = 20√3 m</p>
<p>Also,</p>
<p>OB + OD = 80 m</p>
<p>OB = (80-60) m = 20 m</p>
<p>Thus, the height of the poles are 20√3 m and distance from the point of elevation are 20 m and</p>
<p>60 m respectively.</p>

Find the height of the tower and the width of the canal.
</p>
<img class="Q2ch3-5n mode" src="https://pathanto.com/Pathanto/image/cl10-ex9.1-11.jpeg" alt="NCERT Ex-9.1 class 10"><br>

<p><h6 class="answer">Answer</h6> Given, AB is the height of the tower.</p>
<p>DC = 20 m (given)</p>
<p>As per given diagram, In right ΔABD,</p>
<p>tan 30° = AB/BD</p>
<p>1/√3 = AB/(20+BC)</p>
<p>AB = (20+BC)/√3 … (i)</p>
<p>Again,</p>
<p>In right ΔABC,</p>
<p>tan 60° = AB/BC</p>
<p>√3 = AB/BC</p>
<p>AB = √3 BC … (ii)</p>
<p>From equation (i) and (ii)</p>
<p>√3 BC = (20+BC)/√3</p>
<p>3 BC = 20 + BC</p>
<p>2 BC = 20</p>
<p>BC = 10</p>
<p>Putting the value of BC in equation (ii)</p>
<p>AB = 10√3</p>
<p>This implies, the height of the tower is 10√3 m and the width of the canal is 10 m.</p>

<h6 class="answer">Answer</h6>
<p>Let AB be the building of height 7 m and EC be the height of the tower.</p>
<p>A is the point from where elevation of tower is 60° and the angle of depression of its foot is 45°.</p>
<p>EC = DE + CD</p>
<p>Also, CD = AB = 7 m. and BC = AD</p>
<p>To Find: EC = Height of the tower</p>
<p>Design a figure based on given instructions:</p>

<p>In right ΔABC,</p>
<p>tan 45° = AB/BC</p>
<p>1= 7/BC</p>
<p>BC = 7</p>
<p>Since BC = AD</p>
<p>So AD = 7</p>
<p>Again, from right triangle ADE,</p>
<p>tan 60° = DE/AD</p>
<p>√3 = DE/7</p>
<p>⇒ DE = 7√3 m</p>
<p>Now: EC = DE + CD</p>
<p>= (7√3 + 7) = 7(√3+1)</p>
<p>Therefore, Height of the tower is 7(√3+1) m. Answer!</p>

<p>Let the initial position of the balloon be A and final position be B.</p>
<p>Height of balloon above the girl height = 88.2 m – 1.2 m = 87 m.</p>
<p>To Find: Distance travelled by the balloon = DE = CE – CD</p>
<p>Let us redesign the given figure as per our convenient</p>

<p>tan 30° = BE/CE</p>
<p>1/√3= 87/CE</p>
<p>CE = 87√3</p>
<p>Step 2:</p>
<p>In right ΔADC,</p>
<p>tan 60° = AD/CD</p>
<p>√3= 87/CD</p>
<p>CD = 87/√3 = 29√3</p>
<p>Step 3:</p>
<p>DE = CE – CD = (87√3 – 29√3) = 29√3(3 – 1) = 58√3</p>
<p>Distance travelled by the balloon = 58√3 m.</p>

A man standing at the top of the tower observes a car at an angle of depression of 30°, which is approaching the foot of the tower with a uniform speed. Six seconds later, the angle of depression of the car is found to be 60°. Find the time taken by the car to reach the foot of the tower from this point.
</p>
<img class="Q2ch3-5n mode" src="https://pathanto.com/Pathanto/image/cl10-ex9.1-16.png" alt="NCERT Ex-9.1 class 10"><br>
<h6 class="answer">Answer</h6>
</p>

<p>Let AB be the tower.</p>
<p>D is the initial and C is the final position of the car respectively.</p>
<p>Since man is standing at the top of the tower so, Angles of depression are measured from A.</p>
<p>BC is the distance from the foot of the tower to the car.</p>

<p>Step 1: In right ΔABC,</p>
<p>tan 60° = AB/BC</p>
<p>√3 = AB/BC</p>
<p>BC = AB/√3</p>
<p>AB = √3 BC</p>
<p>Step 2:</p>
<p>In right ΔABD,</p>
<p>tan 30° = AB/BD</p>
<p>1/√3 = AB/BD</p>
<p>AB = BD/√3</p>
<p>Step 3: Form step 1 and Step 2, we have</p>
<p>√3 BC = BD/√3 (Since LHS are same, so RHS are also same)</p>
<p>3 BC = BD</p>
<p>3 BC = BC + CD</p>
<p>2BC = CD</p>
<p>or BC = CD/2</p>
<p>Here, distance of BC is half of CD. Thus, the time taken is also half.</p>
<p>Time taken by car to travel distance CD = 6 sec. Time taken by car to travel BC = 6/2 = 3 sec.</p>

<h6 class="answer">Answer</h6>
</p>
<p>Let AB be the tower. C and D be the two points with distance 4 m and 9 m from the base respectively. As per question,</p>

<p>In right ΔABC,</p>
<p>tan x = AB/BC</p>
<p>tan x = AB/4</p>
<p>AB = 4 tan x … (i)</p>
<p>Again, from right ΔABD,</p>
<p>tan (90°-x) = AB/BD</p>
<p>cot x = AB/9</p>
<p>AB = 9 cot x … (ii)</p>
<p>Multiplying equation (i) and (ii)</p>
<p>AB<sup>2</sup> = 9 cot x × 4 tan x</p>
<p>⇒ AB<sup>2</sup> = 36 (because cot x = 1/tan x</p>
<p>⇒ AB = ± 6</p>
<p>Since height cannot be negative. Therefore, the height of the tower is 6 m.</p>
<p>Hence Proved.</p>
