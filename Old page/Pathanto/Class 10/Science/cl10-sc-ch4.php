<p>(d) the fuel is burning completely.</p>
<p><h4 class="answer">Answer </h4> b)the fuel is not burning completely</p>

<p><h4 class="question">Question 4</h4> Explain the nature of the covalent bond using the bond formation in CH<sub>3</sub>Cl</p>
<p><h4 class="answer">Answer </h4>CH<sub>3</sub>Cl is form by 1 carbom atom and 3 hydrogen and 1 chlorine Carbon has four valence electrons. It shares 1 electron  with 3 hydrogen atoms and 1 electron with chlorine 
	---

 Chlorine has 7 electron in outer shell.It completes its outer shell by sharing  one electron of carbon atom and 3 hydrogen atoms complete their shells by sharing three electrons of carbon atom.

	 CH<sub>3</sub>Cl completes its octet configuration.Hence the bonding that exists in CH<sub>3</sub>Cl is a covalent bonding.</p>

<p><h4 class="question">Question 6</h4> What is a homologous series? Explain with an example.</p>
<p> <h4 class="answer">Answer </h4> A series of compounds in which the same functional group substitutes for hydrogen in a carbon chain is called a homologous series.The general formula of this series is C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n+2</sub>
</p>
<p>For example Methane CH<sub>4</sub> Ethane CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>3</sub></p>

<p><h4 class="question">Question 8</h4> Why does micelle formation take place when soap is added to water? Will a micelle be formed in other solvents such as ethanol also?</p>
<p><h4 class="answer">Answer </h4> Soap molecule has two ends. One end is hydrophilic and another end is hydrophobic. when soap is added to water Micelle formation takes place due  the hydrocarbon chains of soap molecules are hydrophobic  which are insoluble in water, but the ionic ends of soap molecules are hydrophilic that is, it interacts with water and hence soluble in water.Micelle is not formed in other solvent such as ethanol.

<p><h4 class="question">Question 9</h4> Why are carbon and its compounds used as fuels for most applications?</p>
<p><h4 class="answer">Answer </h4> Carbon and its compounds have large amount  calorific values  which give out a lot of energy.That why we  used carbon and its compounds as fuels for most applications</p>

<p> <h4 class="question">Question 10</h4> Explain the formation of scum when hard water is treated with soap?</p>
<p><h4 class="answer">Answer </h4> Calcium and magnesium present in the hard water react with soap to from insoluble precipitate  which is  called as scrum.</p>

<p><h4 class="question">Question 11</h4> What change will you observe if you test soap with litmus paper (red and blue)?</p>
<p><h4 class="answer">Answer </h4>
 soap is alkaline in nature so it turn Red litmus to  blue.but in the soap solution, the blue litmus remains blue.</p>

<p><h4 class="question">Question 12</h4>What is hydrogenation? What is its industrial application?</p>
<p><h4 class="answer">Answer </h4>Hydrogenation is an addition reaction between the hydrogen and other compounds in the presence of a catalyst to give saturated hydrocarbons. It is used to prepare vegetable ghee (or vanaspati ghee) from vegetable oils.</p>

<p><h4 class="question">Question 13</h4> Which of the following hydrocarbons undergo addition reactions: C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub>, C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub>.</p>
<p><h4 class="answer">Answer </h4> Only unsaturated hydrocarbons undergo addition reactions. C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>6</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> are unsaturated hydrocarbons which undergo addition reactions.</p>

<p><h4 class="question">Question 14</h4> Give a test that can be used to differentiate between saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons.</p>
<p><h4 class="answer">Answer </h4> Bromine water test â€“ is used to differentiate between the unsaturated compounds  and the saturated compounds. So  bromine is used in the form of bromine water.  Bromine water has a red-brown color due to the presence of bromine in it. When bromine water is added to an unsaturated compound, then bromine gets added to the unsaturated compound and the red-brown color of bromine water is discharged. then it will be an unsaturated hydrocarbon  but saturated hydrocarbon  do not decolorize bromine water.</p>

<p><h4 class="question">Question 15</h4> Explain the mechanism of the cleaning action of soaps.</p>
<p>
	<h4 class="answer">Answer </h4> A soap molecule have of two parts:
tail. It is hydrophobic in nature.<br>
Head: It is hydrophilic in nature.<br>
When soap  added to dirty water then the hydrophobic part of soap get attach to dirt while the hydrophilic part remain on the surface of water.This formation is called a micelle. Soap in the form of a micelle is able
to clean, since the oily dirt will be collected in the centre of the micelle. The micelles stay in solution as
a colloid and will not come together to precipitat because of ion-ion repulsion. Thus, the dirt
suspended in the micelles is also easily rinsed away
