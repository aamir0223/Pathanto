What is a balanced chemical equation ? Why should chemical equations be balanced ?<br />
<h4 class="answer">Answer</h4>
A balanced chemical equation is the total mass of the elements present in  products side  and in  reactant side are equal in chemical reaction</p>
<p>We need to balance chemical equation because it followthe law of conservation of mass.According to this law, mass can neither be created nor be destroyed in a chemical reaction</p>

<p><h4 class="question">Question 9</h4>
What does one mean by exothermic and endothermic reactions ? Give examples.<br />
<h4 class="answer">Answer</h4>
A reactions in which heat is evolved are known as exothermic reactions <br>
Example :<br />
(i) C (s) + O<sub>2</sub> (g) → CO<sub>2</sub> (g) + Heat<br />
(ii) N<sub>2</sub> (g) + 3H<sub>2</sub> (g) → 2NH<sub>3</sub> (g) + Heat</p>
<p>Endothermic reactions : Those reactions in which heat is absorbed are known as endothermic reactions. it is usually indicated by writing &#8220;Heat” on the left side of a chemical equation.<br />
Examples :<br />
(i) C (s) + 2S (s) → CS<sub>2</sub> (l) &#8211; Heat<br />
(ii) N<sub>2</sub> (g) + O<sub>2</sub> (g) → 2NO(g) &#8211; Heat</p>
<p><h4 class="question">Question 10</h4>
Why is respiration considered an exothermic reaction ? Explain.<br />
<h4 class="answer">Answer</h4>
Respiration is an exothermic process because during respiration glucose combines with oxygen in the cells of our body to form carbon dioxide and water along with the production of energy.<br />

<p><h4 class="question">Question 11</h4>
Why are decomposition reactions called the opposite of combination reactions? Write equations for these reactions.<br />
<h4 class="answer">Answer</h4>
In combination reaction when two or more substance combine to form a single product with large amount of heat  is called combination reaction 
For example:<br />
N<sup>2</sup> + 3H<sub>2</sub> &#8211; 2NH<sub>3</sub> + heat;
</p>
<p>
In a decomposition reaction require energy either in the form of heat or light or electricity for breaking down the reactants into two or more products<br>
2NH<sub>3</sub> + Heat &#8211;  N<sub>2</sub> + 3H<sub>2</sub>;
 <br/>
</p>
<p><h4 class="question">Question 12</h4>

 <br />
<h4 class="answer">Answer</h4>
Decomposition reactions involving of heat<br>
CaCo<sub>3</sub>(s) &#8211; CaO(s) + CO<sub>2</sub>(g)<br>
Decomposition reactions involving of light<br>
2AgCl &#8211; 2Ag(s) + Cl<sub>2</sub>(g)<br>
Decomposition reactions involving of electrical energy<br>
------

</p>
<p><h4 class="question">Question 13</h4>
What is the difference between displacement and double displacement reactions? Write equations for these reactions.<br />
<h4 class="answer">Answer</h4><br />
A displacement reactions in which a  more reactive metal displaces a less reactive metal from its compound. For example,<br />
Zn(s) + CuSO<sub>4</sub>(aq) → Cu(s) + ZnSO<sub>4</sub>(aq)<br />
here  Zinc is more reactive   displaces copper from its solution.<br />
A double displacement reactions, a mutual exchange of ions between two compound to form two new compound. For example,<br />
AgNO<sub>3</sub>(aq) + NaCl (aq) → AgCl(s) + NaNO<sub>3</sub> (aq)<br />
Here silver nitrate and sodium chloride exchange Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#8211;</sup>  and form two new compound.</p>
<p><h4 class="question">Question 14</h4>
In the refining of silver, the recovery of silver from silver nitrate solution involved displacement by copper metal. Write down the reaction involved.<br />
<h4 class="answer">Answer</h4>  2AgNO<sub>3</sub>(aq)  +Cu(s) &#8211; 2Ag(s) +Cu(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(aq)

</p>
<p><h4 class="question">Question 15</h4>
What do you mean by a precipitation reaction ? Explain by giving examples.<br />
<h4 class="answer">Answer</h4>
When two reactants in solution react and one or more of the products form, which  is insoluble  in water or forms a precipitate, the reaction is called a precipitation reaction<br />
Example : Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub><br />

<p><h4 class="question">Question 16</h4>
Explain the following in terms of gain or loss of oxygen with two examples each:<br />
(a) Oxidation and<br />
(b) Reduction.<br />
<h4 class="answer">Answer</h4>
(a) Oxidation : It is define as the  gain of oxygen to a substance is called oxidation.<br />
(i) C(s) + O<sub>2</sub>(g) → CO<sub>2</sub> <br />
In the recation C gain oxygen to  form CO.
(ii) 2Mg(s) + O<sub>2</sub> (g) → 2MgO(s) </p>
In the recation Mg gain oxygen to  form MgO.
<p>(b) Reduction : It is define as the loss of oxygen from a substance is called reduction.<br />
Example: (i) CuO + H2 &#8211; Cu + H<sub>2</sub>O<br />
In the recation copper oxide is being  lossing  oxygen and it is reduced to copper.</p>
<p>(ii) ZnO + C &#8211; Zn + CO<br />
Here, zinc oxide is being lossing  oxygen and it is reduced to zinc .</p>
<p><h4 class="question">Question 17</h4>
A shiny brown coloured element ‘X’ on heating in air becomes black in colour. Name the element ‘X’ and the black coloured compound formed.<br /></p>
<h4 class="answer">Answer</h4>
Element ‘X’ is copper (Cu).The black coloured compound is copper oxide (CuO). <br />
 
<p><h4 class="question">Question 18</h4>
Why do we apply paint on iron articles ?<br />
<h4 class="answer">Answer</h4>
We apply paint on iron articles because it does not allow  air, moisture to attack on  iron articles and  there no risk of rusting .</p>
<p><h4 class="question">Question 19</h4>
Oil and fat containing food items are flushed with nitrogen. Why ?<br />
<h4 class="answer">Answer</h4>Oil and fat containing food items flushed with nitrogen because food get exposed in the presence air and get oxidised which have bed taste and becomes rancid and  nitrogen acts as an antioxidant and it prevent them from being oxidised.<br />
</p>
<p><h4 class="question">Question 20</h4>
Explain the following terms with one example each (a) Corrosion, (b) Rancidity.<br />
<h4 class="answer">Answer</h4>
i. Corrosion: It is a  process of slow  decay of the metals due to the attack of air, moisture, acids, etc. on the surface of metals is called corrosion. eg. Iron forms reddish brown coloured coating on iron .<br>
<br>
 ii. Rancidity: The oxidation of oils and fats in foods give  a bad smell , taste and unfit for consumption a is called rancidity 
  Rancid of  old  
cooking oil</p>
