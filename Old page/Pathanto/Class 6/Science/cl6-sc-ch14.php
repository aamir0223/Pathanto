 How are clouds formed?<br>

<h6 class="answer">Answer 7</h6>
s

Clouds are formed by the process of evaporation and condensation.The process of condensation plays an important role in bringing water back to the surface of the earth. At a certain height  from the surface of the earth, it gets cooler. When the air moves up, it gets  cooler and air becomes so cool that the water vapor present in it condenses to form tiny drops of water called droplets. It is these tiny droplets that remain floating in the air and appear to us like clouds.<br><br>


<h6 class="question">Question 8</h6>
 When does a drought occur?
