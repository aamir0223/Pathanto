<h6 class="question">Question 1</h6>

Find the HCF of the following numbers :<br>
(a) 18, 48 (b) 30, 42
(c) 18, 60(d) 27, 63
(e) 36, 84(f) 34, 102(g) 70, 105, 175
(h) 91, 112, 49<br>
(i) 18, 54, 81
(j) 12, 45, 75
<h6 class="answer">Answer 1</h6>


<div class="row">
  <div class="col-lg-6">
    
    <p>
   (a) 8,48<br>

Factor of 18 = 2 x 3 x 3<br>
Factor of 48 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 3<br>
Required HCF = 2 x 3 = 6<br>


 
(b) 30, 42<br>
factor of  30 = 2 x 3 x 5<br>
Factor of  42 = 2 x 3 x 7<br>
Required HCF = 2 x 3 = 6<br>

(c) 18,60<br>
Factor of 18 = 2 x 3 x 3<br>
Factor of 60 = 2 x 2 x 3 x 5<br>
Required HCF =2x 3 =6<br>


 
(d) 27,63<br>
Factors of 27 = 1 x 3 x 3 x 3.<br>
Factors of 63 =1 x  3 x 3 x 7.<br>
Highest of these common factors is 3 x 3<br>.
H.C.F. of 27 , 63 is 9.

(e) 36,84<br>
36 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 3<br>
84 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 7<br>
Required HCF = 2 × 2 × 3 = 12<br>
f) 34,102 <br>
34 = 2 × 17<br>

102 = 2 × 3 × 17<br>

Required HCF = 2 × 17 = 34<br>

So,the HCF of 34, 102 is 34

  </div>
  <div class="col-lg-6" >
    
    <p>
    

 
(g) 70,105,175<br>
Factors of 70 = 2 × 5 × 7<br>

Factors of 105 = 3 × 5 × 7<br>

Factors of 175 = 5 × 5 × 7<br>

Required HCF = 5 × 7 = 35<br>

So,the HCF of 70, 105 and 175 is 35

(h) 91,112,49<br>
Factors of 91 = 7 × 13<br>

Factors of  112 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 7<br>

Factors of  49 = 7 × 7<br>

Required HCF = 7<br>
So,the HCF of 91, 112 and 49 is 7<br>

(i) 18,54,81<br>
Factors of 18 = 2 × 3 × 3<br>

Factors of 54 = 2 × 3 × 3 × 3<br>

Factors of 81 = 3 × 3 × 3 × 3<<br>

Required HCF = 3 × 3 = 9<br>

Therefore the HCF of 18, 54 and 81 is 9<br>
(j) 12, 45, 75<br>
Factors of 12 = 2 × 2 × 3<br>

Factors of 45 = 3 × 3 × 5<br>

Factors of 75 = 3 × 5 × 5<br>

Required HCF = 3<br>

So the HCF of 12, 45 and 75 is 3<br>

<h6 class="question">Question 2</h6>
What is the H.C.F. of two consecutive :<br>
(a) numbers?<br>
(b) even numbers?<br>
(c) odd numbers?<br>
<h6 class="answer">Answer 2</h6>
(a) The H.C.F. of two consecutive numbers is 1.<br>
Ex: The HCF of 11 and 12 is 1<br>
(b) The H.C.F. of two consecutive even numbers is 2.<br>
Ex The HCF of 6 and 8 is 2<br>
(c) The H.C.F. of two consecutive odd numbers is 1.<br>
ExThe HCF of 7 and 9 is 1<br> <br>
<h6 class="question">Question 3</h6>
H. C.F. of co-prime numbers 4 and 15 was found as follows factorization: 4 = 2 × 2 and 15 = 3 × 5 since there is no common prime factor, so H.C.F. of 4 and 15 is 0. Is the answer correct? If not, what is the correct H.C.F?
<h6 class="answer">Answer 4</h6>
No, the answer is not correct. The correct answer is 1 :
H.C.F. of 4 and 15 is 1.<br><br>
