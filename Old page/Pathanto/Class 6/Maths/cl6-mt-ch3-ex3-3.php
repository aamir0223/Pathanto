 <h6 class="question" >Question 4.</h6>
Using divisibility tests, determine which of the following numbers are divisible by 11:<br>
(a) 5445
(b) 10824
(c) 7138965
(d) 70169308<br>
(e) 10000001
(f) 901153
<h6 class="answer">Answer 4:</h6>
We know that a number is divisible by 11, if the difference in odd places and the sum of its digits in even places is either 0 or a  divisible by 11.<br>



<div class="row">
  <div class="col-lg-6">
    
    <p>
    (a)  5445<br>
Sum of its digits at odd places = 5 + 4 = 9<br>
Sum of its digit at even places = 4 + 5 = 9<br>
Difference of these two places = 9 – 9 = 0<br>
the difference is 0 5445 is divisible by 11.<br>

(b) 10824<br>
Sum of its digits at odd places = 4+ 8 + 1 = 13<br>
Sum of its digits at even places =2 + 0 =2<br>
Difference of these two places =13 – 2 = 11<br>
the difference is 11 So 10824 is divisible by 11.<br>

(c)  7138965<br>
Sum of its digits at odd places = 5+ 9+ 3 + 7= 24<br>
Sum of its digits at even places = 6+ 8 + 1 = 15<br>
Difference of these two places = 24 – 15 = 9<br>
the difference is 9 So 7138965 is not divisible by 11.<br>

  </div>
  <div class="col-lg-6" >
    
   <p>
   (d)  70169308<br>
Sum of its digits at odd places = 8 + 3 + 6 + 0=17<br>
Sum of its digits at even places = 0 + 9 + 1 + 7 = 17<br>
Difference of these two places =17 – 17 = 0<br>
the difference is 0 So 70169308 is divisible by 11.<br>

(e) 10000001<br>
Sum of its digits at odd places = 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1<br>
Sum of its digits at even places = 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 1<br>
Difference of these two sums = 1 – 1 = 0<br>
the difference is 0 So 10000001 is divisible by 11.<br>

(f)  901153<br>
Sum of its digits at odd places = 3 + 1 + 0 = 4<br>
Sum of its digits at even places = 5 + 1 + 9=15<br>
Difference of these two places =15 – 4 = 11,<br>

the difference is 11 So 901153 is divisible by 11.<br>

<h6 class="question">Question 5</h6>
Write the smallest digit and the greatest digit in the blank space of each of the following numbers so that the number formed is divisible by 3 :<br>
(a)_______ 6724
(b) 4765 _______ 2
<h6 class="answer">Answer 5:</h6>
We know that if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3 then it  divisible by 3, <br>
(a) _______6724
  Here<br>
 6 + 7 + 2 + 4 =19, when we add 2 to 19, the result number 21 will be divisible by 3.<br>
 The  smallest digit is 2.<br>
Again,<br>
 when we  add 8 to 19, the result number 27 will be divisible by 3<br>The largest digit is 8.<br>

(b) 4765 _____ 2
Here<br>
 4 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 2 = 24, it is divisible by 3.<br>
the  smallest digit is 0.<br>
Again, <br>
when we  add 9 to 24, the resulting number 33 will be divisible by 3.<br>
 The largest digit is 9.<br><br>

<h6 class="question">Question 6</h6>
Write a digit in the blank space of each of the following numbers so that the number formed is divisible by 11:<br>
(a) 92_______ 389
(b) 8____ 9484
<h6 class="answer">Answer 6:</h6>
We know that a number is divisible by 11, if the difference of the sum of its digits at odd places and  even places is either 0 or divisible by 11.<br>
(a) 92 ___389<br>
sum of digits at even places<br>
= 9 + 3 + 2 = 14<br>
= 8 + required digit + 9
= required digit+ 17<br>
Difference between these sums<br>
= required digit + 17 – 14<br>
= required digit + 3<br>
For complete divisible by 11<br>
=required digit + 3=11<br>
=required digi=11-3=8<br>

So, the required smallest digit = 8 .<br>

(b) 8…9484<br>
sum of digits at even places<br>
= 8 + 9 + 8 = 25<br>
 sum of the digits at odd places<br>
= 4 + 4 + required digit<br>
= 8 + required digit<br>

Difference<br>
= 25 – (8 + required digit)<br>
= 17- required digit<br>
or complete divisible by 11<br>
17- required digit=11<br>
=17-11=required digit<br>


So the required smallest digit = 6<br>
